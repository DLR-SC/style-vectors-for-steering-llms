Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .
And art thou changed ?
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
And badest me bury love .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .
I pray thee , chide not .
The other did not so .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .
Oh , let us hence .
I stand on sudden haste .
Wisely and slow .
They stumble that run fast .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?
Came he not home tonight ?
Not to his father's .
I spoke with his man .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .
A challenge , on my life .
Romeo will answer it .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .
Alas , poor Romeo !
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?
Why , what is Tybalt ?
The what ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .
Good morrow to you both .
What counterfeit did I give you ?
The slip , sir , the slip .
Can you not conceive ?
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .
I serve as good a man as you .
No better .
Well , sir .
You lie .
You know not what you do .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?
Come between us , good Benvolio .
My wits faints .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .
Was I with you there for the goose ?
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
Nay , good goose , bite not .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .
It is a most sharp sauce .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
Now art thou sociable .
Now art thou Romeo .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
Oh , thou art deceived .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .
Here's goodly gear .
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .
Peter !
Anon !
My fan , Peter .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .
Is it good e'en ?
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .
Out upon you !
What a man are you ?
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .
By my troth , it is well said .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .
You say well .
Yea , is the worst well ?
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .
She will indite him to some supper .
So ho !
What hast thou found ?
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?
We'll to dinner , thither .
I will follow you .
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .
Scurvy knave !
I am none of his flirt-gills .
I am none of his skains-mates .
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .
Scurvy knave !
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?
Thou dost not mark me .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .
And stay , good Nurse .
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .
Farewell .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .
Farewell .
Commend me to thy mistress .
Now God in heaven bless thee !
Hark you , sir .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?
Is your man secret ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .
Commend me to thy lady .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !
Anon !
Before and apace .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .
Perchance she can not meet him .
That's not so .
Oh , she is lame !
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?
Hast thou met with him ?
Send thy man away .
Peter , stay at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .
I am aweary .
Give me leave awhile .
Fie , how my bones ache !
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .
Can you not stay awhile ?
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
Is thy news good , or bad ?
Answer to that .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .
Let me be satisfied .
Is 't good or bad ?
Well , you have made a simple choice .
You know not how to choose a man .
Romeo !
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
Go thy ways , wench .
Serve God .
What , have you dined at home ?
No , no .
But all this did I know before .
What says he of our marriage ?
What of that ?
My back a ' t ' other side .
Ah , my back , my back !
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?
Where is my mother ?
Why , she is within .
Where should she be ?
How oddly thou repliest !
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?
Marry , come up , I trow .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .
Here's such a coil .
Come , what says Romeo ?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?
I have .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .
There stays a husband to make you a wife .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .
Hie you to church .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .
Go .
I'll to dinner .
Hie you to the cell .
I do but keep the peace .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .
Have at thee , coward !
Clubs , bills , and partisans !
Strike !
Beat them down !
Down with the Capulets !
Down with the Montagues !
What noise is this ?
My sword , I say !
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .
Thou villain Capulet !
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .
Hie to high fortune !
Honest Nurse , farewell .
Amen , amen .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .
Therefore love moderately .
Long love doth so .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
Here comes the lady .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .
Am I like such a fellow ?
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
And what to ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .
The fee simple ?
O simple !
By my head , here comes the Capulets .
By my heel , I care not .
Couple it with something .
Make it a word and a blow .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .
Here all eyes gaze on us .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .
Well , peace be with you , sir .
Here comes my man .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .
Villain am I none .
Therefore , farewell .
I see thou know'st me not .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .
Therefore turn and draw .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !
What wouldst thou have with me ?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .
I am for you .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .
Away , Tybalt .
I am hurt .
A plague o ' both your houses !
I am sped .
Is he gone and hath nothing ?
What , art thou hurt ?
Marry , 'tis enough .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .
Courage , man .
The hurt can not be much .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .
A plague o ' both your houses !
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !
Why the devil came you between us ?
I was hurt under your arm .
I thought all for the best .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .
A plague o ' both your houses !
They have made worms ' meat of me .
I have it , And soundly too .
Your houses !
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .
This shall determine that .
Romeo , away , be gone !
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .
Stand not amazed .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .
Hence , be gone , away !
Why dost thou stay ?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?
There lies that Tybalt .
Speak , nephew .
Were you by when it began ?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .
Tybalt , my cousin !
O my brother's child !
O cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .
He speaks not true .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .
Romeo slew Tybalt .
Romeo must not live .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .
Come , night .
Come , Romeo .
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?
Ay , ay , the cords .
Ay me , what news ?
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?
Ah , welladay !
We are undone , lady , we are undone !
Alack the day !
Can heaven be so envious ?
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .
Vile earth , to earth resign .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !
That ever I should live to see thee dead .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
It did , it did .
Alas the day , it did .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
Shame come to Romeo !
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !
He was not born to shame .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .
All this is comfort .
Wherefore weep I then ?
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .
No words can that woe sound .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .
Will you go to them ?
I will bring you thither .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !
Hie to your chamber .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .
I wot well where he is .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .
I'll to him .
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .
Romeo , come forth .
Come forth , thou fearful man .
Father , what news ?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?
Ha , banishment !
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
O deadly sin !
O rude unthankfulness !
Tis torture and not mercy .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .
They are free men , but I am banished .
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .
Howling attends it .
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .
I drew to part them .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .
Oh , where is Romeo ?
Saw you him today ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
Talk no more .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .
Arise .
One knocks .
Good Romeo , hide thyself .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .
Who knocks so hard ?
Whence come you ?
What's your will ?
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?
Where's Romeo ?
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Stand , an you be a man .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?
Nurse !
Ah sir , ah sir .
Death's the end of all .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?
How is it with her ?
Where is she ?
And how doth she ?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .
Art thou a man ?
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .
Thou hast amazed me .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .
What , rouse thee , man !
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .
Romeo is coming .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .
Oh , what learning is !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
How well my comfort is revived by this !
Go hence .
Good night .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .
Sojourn in Mantua .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .
Give me thy hand .
Tis late .
Farewell .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .
Well , we were born to die .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .
Madam , good night .
Commend me to your daughter .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !
What day is this ?
Monday , my lord .
Monday !
Ha , ha .
Do you like this haste ?
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .
But what say you to Thursday ?
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .
Well get you gone .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .
Wilt thou be gone ?
It is not yet near day .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .
Therefore stay yet .
Thou need'st not to be gone .
Let me be ta'en .
Let me be put to death .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .
I have more care to stay than will to go .
Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .
It is not day .
It is , it is .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .
This doth not so , for she divideth us .
More light and light it grows .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
Madam .
Nurse ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .
The day is broke .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .
Farewell , farewell .
One kiss , and I'll descend .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
I neither know it nor can learn of him .
Have you importuned him by any means ?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .
Farewell !
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .
Adieu , adieu !
O fortune , fortune !
All men call thee fickle .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .
Who is 't that calls ?
Is it my lady mother ?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?
Madam , I am not well .
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .
Therefore , have done .
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .
What villain , madam ?
That same villain , Romeo .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !
Then weep no more .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .
These are news indeed !
Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .
How now ?
A conduit , girl ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?
I would the fool were married to her grave !
How , will she none ?
Is she not proud ?
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .
How , how , how , how ?
Chopped logic !
What is this ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?
Out , you green sickness , carrion !
Out , you baggage !
You tallow face !
Fie , fie !
What , are you mad ?
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .
Speak not .
Reply not .
Do not answer me .
Out on her , hilding !
God in heaven bless her !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?
Smatter with your gossips , go .
I speak no treason .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .
May not one speak ?
Peace , you mumbling fool !
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .
You are too hot .
God's bread !
It makes me mad .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched .
Thursday is near .
Lay hand on heart , advise .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
Trust to 't , bethink you .
I'll not be forsworn .
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?
Comfort me .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?
Some comfort , Nurse .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?
Amen !
What ?
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .
O most wicked fiend !
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .
On Thursday , sir ?
The time is very short .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .
I like it not .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .
Good morrow , cousin .
Is the day so young ?
But new struck nine .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?
It was .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .
In love ?
Out .
Of love ?
Where shall we dine ? , O me !
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .
What must be shall be .
That's a certain text .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .
Do not deny to him that you love me .
I will confess to you that I love him .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .
Hold , then .
Wednesday is tomorrow .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .
Give me , give me !
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .
Farewell , dear Father .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .
How canst thou try them so ?
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .
Go , be gone .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .
Ay , forsooth .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .
Send for the county .
Go tell him of this .
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .
Why , I am glad on 't .
This is well .
Stand up .
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !
Our whole city is much bound to him .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?
No , not till Thursday .
There is time enough .
We'll to church tomorrow .
Tis now near night .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .
I'll not to bed tonight .
Let me alone .
I'll play the housewife for this once .
Ay , those attires are best .
What , are you busy , ho ?
Need you my help ?
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .
Good night .
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .
Come , vial .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?
Lie thou there .
Oh , look !
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Here's drink .
I drink to thee .
No , coz , I rather weep .
Good heart , at what ?
Why , such is love's transgression .
What is it else ?
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .
Farewell , my coz .
Soft !
I will go along .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
Tut , I have lost myself .
I am not here .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?
Groan !
Why , no .
But sadly , tell me who .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .
Come , stir , stir , stir !
The second cock hath crowed .
The curfew bell hath rung .
Spare not for the cost .
Go , you cot-quean , go .
Get you to bed , faith .
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !
Now , fellow , What is there ?
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .
Mass , and well said .
A merry whoreson , ha !
Thou shalt be loggerhead. , Good faith , 'tis day .
Wife !
What , ho ?
What , Nurse , I say !
Go waken Juliet .
Go and trim her up .
I'll go and chat with Paris .
Hie , make haste , Make haste .
The bridegroom he is come already .
Make haste , I say .
Mistress !
What , mistress !
Juliet ! , Fast , I warrant her , she. , Why , lamb !
Why , lady !
Why , love , I say .
Madam !
Sweet-heart !
Why , bride !
What , not a word ?
You take your pennyworths now .
How sound is she asleep !
Ay , let the county take you in your bed .
He'll fright you up , i ' faith .
Will it not be ?
What noise is here ?
O lamentable day !
What is the matter ?
Look , look .
O heavy day !
O me , O me !
My child , my only life , Revive , look up , or I will die with thee ! , Help , help !
For shame , bring Juliet forth .
Her lord is come .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
Alack the day !
Alack the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Ha ?
Let me see her .
Out , alas !
She's cold .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .
Life and these lips have long been separated .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .
O lamentable day !
O woeful time .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
Ready to go , but never to return .
Death is my son-in-law .
Death is my heir .
My daughter he hath wedded .
I will die , And leave him all .
Life , living , all is Death's .
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !
O woe !
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !
Never was seen so black a day as this .
O woeful day , O woeful day !
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !
O love !
O life !
Not life , but love in death .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?
My soul , and not my child !
Dead art thou !
Peace , ho , for shame !
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .
Now heaven hath all ,
And all the better is it for the maid .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .
Not a dump , we .
Tis no time to play now .
You will not then ?
No .
I will then give it you soundly .
What will you give us ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .
I will give you the minstrel .
Then I will give you the serving creature .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .
I will carry no crotchets .
Then have at you with my wit .
Answer me like men .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?
Faith , I know not what to say .
I will say for you .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .
What a pestilent knave is this same !
Hang him , Jack !
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .
Ah me !
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
How doth my lady ?
Is my father well ?
How fares my Juliet ?
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .
A right good markman !
And she's fair I love .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
Well , in that hit you miss .
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .
Be ruled by me .
Forget to think of her .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !
Is it e'en so ?
Then I defy you , stars !
Thou know'st my lodging .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .
I will hence tonight .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .
Tush , thou art deceived .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
No , my good lord .
No matter .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .
I'll be with thee straight .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .
Let's see for means .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
As I remember , this should be the house .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .
What , ho !
Apothecary !
Who calls so loud ?
Come hither , man .
I see that thou art poor .
Hold , there is forty ducats .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?
Famine is in thy cheeks .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Brother , ho !
This same should be the voice of Friar John .
Welcome from Mantua .
What says Romeo ?
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?
Unhappy fortune !
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .
Now must I to the monument alone .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !
Give me thy torch , boy .
Hence , and stand aloof .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .
Give me those flowers .
Do as I bid thee , go .
Yet I will adventure .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?
What with a torch !
Muffle me , night , awhile .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
So shalt thou show me friendship .
Take thou that .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .
Fly hence and leave me .
Think upon these gone .
Let them affright thee .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .
O , be gone !
Stay not , be gone .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .
Wilt thou provoke me ?
Then have at thee , boy !
O Lord , they fight !
I will go call the watch .
Open the tomb .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .
Said he not so ?
Or did I dream it so ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .
A grave ?
Oh , no .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .
Thou art not conquered .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .
Eyes , look your last .
Arms , take your last embrace .
Thy drugs are quick .
Thus with a kiss I die .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .
Saint Francis be my speed !
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Bliss be upon you !
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .
Who is it ?
Romeo .
How long hath he been there ?
Full half an hour .
Go with me to the vault .
I dare not , sir .
Stay , then .
I'll go alone .
Fear comes upon me .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?
O comfortable Friar !
Where is my lord ?
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .
Where is my Romeo ?
I hear some noise .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .
Come , come away .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?
I will kiss thy lips .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .
Yea , noise ?
Then I'll be brief .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .
There rust and let me die .
This is the place .
There , where the torch doth burn .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .
Pitiful sight !
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .
Run to the Capulets .
Raise up the Montagues .
Some others search .
Here's Romeo's man .
We found him in the churchyard .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .
A great suspicion .
Stay the friar too .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
O heavens !
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .
O me !
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?
Look , and thou shalt see .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .
What can he say in this ?
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .
Montague !
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
But saying o'er what I have said before .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .
And too soon marred are those so early made .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .
Find them out whose names are written here ?
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .
For what , I pray thee ?
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .
God 'i ' good e'en .
I pray , sir , can you read ?
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .
Ye say honestly .
Stay , fellow .
I can read .
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .
Whither should they come ?
Up .
Whither ?
To supper ?
To our house .
Whose house ?
My master's .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .
Now I'll tell you without asking .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .
Rest you merry !
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .
One fairer than my love ?
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
Call her forth to me .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .
What , lamb !
How now , who calls ?
Your mother .
Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .
She's not fourteen .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .
Well , Susan is with God .
She was too good for me .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .
That shall she .
Marry , I remember it well .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .
Yes , madam .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .
God mark thee to his grace !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?
It is an honor that I dream not of .
Well , think of marriage now .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .
A man , young lady !
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .
What say you ?
I'll look to like if looking liking move .
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
I must hence to wait .
I beseech you , follow straight .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
Or shall we on without apology ?
The date is out of such prolixity .
But let them measure us by what they will .
Give me a torch .
I am not for this ambling .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .
Not I , believe me .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .
You are a lover .
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .
I strike quickly , being moved .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .
Is love a tender thing ?
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !
Nay , that's not so .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .
Why , may one ask ?
I dreamt a dream tonight .
And so did I .
Well , what was yours ?
That dreamers often lie .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .
On , lusty gentlemen .
Strike , drum .
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !
Ay , boy , ready .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
We can not be here and there too .
Cheerly , boys .
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .
Welcome , gentlemen !
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !
By'r Lady , thirty years .
Tis more , 'tis more .
His son is elder , sir .
His son is thirty .
Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .
I know not , sir .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
Wherefore storm you so ?
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .
Young Romeo is it ?
Tis he , that villain Romeo .
Content thee , gentle coz .
Let him alone .
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .
Therefore be patient .
Take no note of him .
You'll not endure him !
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .
Go to , go to .
You are a saucy boy .
Is 't so , indeed ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .
You must contrary me .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .
Sin from thy lips ?
Give me my sin again .
You kiss by th ' book .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .
What is her mother ?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?
I'll to my rest .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .
Tis all one .
I will show myself a tyrant .
The heads of the maids ?
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .
They must take it in sense that feel it .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .
Tis well thou art not fish .
Draw thy tool !
My naked weapon is out .
Come hither , Nurse .
What is yond gentleman ?
The son and heir of old Tiberio .
What's he that now is going out of door ?
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .
I know not .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .
What's this ?
What's this ?
The strangers all are gone .
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .
Call , good Mercutio .
Nay , I'll conjure too !
Romeo !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
This can not anger him .
My invocation Is fair and honest .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .
Cast it off !
It is my lady .
Oh , it is my love .
Oh , that she knew she were !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .
What of that ?
Her eye discourses .
Tis not to me she speaks .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !
O Romeo , Romeo !
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .
Dost thou love me ?
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .
What shall I swear by ?
Do not swear at all .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?
For what purpose , love ?
But to be frank , and give it thee again .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .
I hear some noise within .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .
Stay but a little .
I will come again .
O blessed , blessed night !
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .
Fear me not .
Let us take the law of our sides .
Let them begin .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .
Nay , as they dare .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
I do bite my thumb , sir .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?
Do you quarrel , sir ?
Quarrel , sir ?
No , sir .
Tomorrow will I send .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !
Romeo !
My nyas ?
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?
By the hour of nine .
I will not fail .
Tis twenty year till then .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .
Tis almost morning .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .
I would I were thy bird .
Sweet , so would I .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .
Good night , good night !
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
Good morrow , Father .
Benedicite .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .
That last is true .
The sweeter rest was mine .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?
That's my good son .
But where hast thou been , then ?
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .
