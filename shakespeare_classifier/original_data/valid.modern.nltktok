Now , you lie there on the path .
She said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
Besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
What's the obvious conclusion from that ?
Just think , I could be Count Malvolio !
Lady Strachy married her wardrobe manager .
I'd send seven of my servants to go get him .
While I waited , I'd frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my , with some expensive piece of jewelry I happen to be wearing .
I can't let my lips say his name ; "No man must know."
No man must know." What comes after that ?
No man must know." What if this someone were you , Malvolio ?
But silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart With strokes that draw no blood .
rules my life." Hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
I may command the one I love." Well , she commands me .
Why , anyone can see what this means .
There's no ambiguity here .
If only I could somehow relate them to me !
You seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , I believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
Please , and I'll pay you plenty for this , help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so I can look the way I want .
I want to be this Duke's servant .
You'll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
You won't be wasting your time , because I really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he'll be happy to have me in his service .
You can be a eunuch , but I'll be mute .
I swear on my life I won't tell your secret .
Thank you .
Show me the way .
M" , Malvolio .
M" , why , that's the first letter in my name .
But if I shake it up a little it'll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
But wait , there's some prose after her poem .
If this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
By my birth I rank above you , but don't be afraid of my greatness .
Some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
Your fate awaits you .
Accept it in body and spirit .
To get used to the life you'll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
Go ahead .
Goodbye .
Signed , she who would be your servant , The Fortunate Unhappy." This is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
I'll do it .
I'll be vain and proud , I'll read up on politics , I'll insult Sir Toby , I'll get rid of my lower-class friends , and I'll be the perfect man for her .
I know I'm not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that Lady Olivia loves me .
She did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
Oh , I thank my lucky stars , I'm so happy .
For her I'll be strange and condescending , and I'll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
Thank God and my horoscope !
Here's a postscript ! .
You must have figured out who I am .
If you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
You're so attractive when you smile .
Please smile whenever you're near me , my dearest darling."
Dear God , thank you !
I'll do everything she wants me to do .
I wouldn't have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of Persia .
I could marry that Maria for thinking this up .
So could I .
And I wouldn't ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
Neither would I .
Here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
May I kiss your feet ?
And I too ?
Shall I be your slave ?
Me too .
You've made him so delusional he'll go crazy when he learns the truth .
Did it really work ?
Like medicine for a sick man .
If you want to watch , follow me .
I'd follow you to the gates of Hell , you sneaky little devil !
I'll come too .
God bless you , my friend , and your music too .
Do you make your living by playing that drum ?
No , sir , I live by the church .
Oh , you're a clergyman ?
You could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it "stands by" your drum .
You're right , sir .
What a wonderful time to be alive !
That's true .
That's why I wish my sister didn't have a name , sir .
Why , man ?
Well , her name's a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
Why do you say that ?
Honestly , sir , I'd need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , I'd rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
I bet you're a happy fellow who doesn't care about anything .
You're wrong , sir , I do care about something .
But I'll admit I don't care for you .
If that means I don't care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you're nothing .
Aren't you Lady Olivia's fool ?
No , sir .
I saw you at Count Orsino's recently .
I'm everywhere .
I think I saw you there , you wise man .
Wait , here's a coin for you .
Next time God sends out a shipment of hair , I hope he gives you a beard !
Oh , I know .
Yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
My lady Olivia's inside , sir .
I'll tell them where you come from , though I don't know who you are or what you want .
I'd say I was "out of my element , " but that phrase is overused , so I'll say I'm "out of my air."
This guy's wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
And he doesn't let go of his target when a distraction appears .
Hello , sir .
Hello to you too , sir .
I'm headed for your niece , sir .
She's the reason I'm here .
Taste your legs , sir .
Please go inside .
I mean please go into the house , sir .
I will .
But now we don't have to !
Oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
My message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
It's only for your willing and receptive ear .
Close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
Give me your hand , sir .
I give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
What's your name ?
Cesario is my name , your servant's name , fair princess .
My servant !
The world's gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
As for him , I never think about him .
As for his thoughts , I wish he'd think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
Madam , I've come here to try to make you like him .
Oh , please , I'm begging you , don't mention him again .
My dear lady , Please let me say something , I'm begging you .
After you cast your magic spell on me last time , I sent you a ring .
What else could you possibly think of me ?
What's wrong with my niece ?
For God's sake , Sir Toby , you've got to come home earlier at night .
My lady Olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
Well , she can get used to it .
Keep myself ?
They're good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
If they aren't , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
Who , Sir Andrew Aguecheek ?
Yes , that's the one .
He's as
Haven't you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
For someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
So let me hear what you have to say .
I feel sorry for you .
That's a step in the direction of love .
No , not at all .
It's much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
I wish you all the best .
You do Stay , Please , tell me what you think of me .
I think you're denying what you really are .
If that's true , I think the same thing about you .
I wish you were what I wanted you to be !
Would it be better if I were that , instead of what I am ?
I wish I were something better , because right now I'm a big fool .
So goodbye , my lady .
No , I won't stay a second longer .
Why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
Yes , you have to tell us why , Sir Andrew .
Well , because I saw your niece Olivia treat the count's messenger better than she's ever treated me .
I saw it in the orchard .
Did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
Tell me that .
Yes , she saw me quite clearly .
Well , that proves she's in love with you .
Are you trying to make fun of me ?
No , I'll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
And you can't deny evidence and argument , They've been around since Noah's ark .
She flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
You should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
That's what she was expecting , and you let her down .
I'll have to do something courageous then , because I hate intrigue .
I'd rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
Well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
Challenge the count's young servant to a fight .
Hurt him in eleven different places .
My niece Olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
It's really the only way , Sir Andrew .
Will either of you give him the message that I'm challenging him to a duel ?
Go ahead and write it down .
Be pointed and brief .
It doesn't need to be witty as long as it's eloquent and imaginative .
Go on .
This precious little guy is putty in your hands , Sir Toby .
His letter's going to be hilarious .
But you're not going to deliver it , are you ?
Never trust me again if I don't .
And by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
I don't think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
Here comes my little bird .
Listen , if you want a good laugh , and I mean a side-splitting one , then follow me .
He's wearing yellow stockings .
With crisscrossed laces ?
Oh , he looks like a pathetic Sunday school teacher .
He smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the East Indies .
You've never seen anything like it .
I can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
I know that my lady's going to end up hitting him .
And when she does , he'll imagine she's flirting with him .
Come on , take us to him .
I couldn't stay behind after you left .
My friend Antonio , all I can say is thank you .
Anyway , what should we do ?
Should we go see the sights in the town ?
You probably killed a lot of his men ?
The whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them , which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
I was the only one who refused to give back what I stole .
Then don't make yourself too conspicuous .
You're right .
Hang on a minute , here's some money for you .
Maybe you'll see some little trinket you want to buy .
I'll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
We'll meet at the Elephant .
I remember .
I've sent for him .
He says he'll come .
It's easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
Oh , I'm talking too loud. , Where's Malvolio ?
He's very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
Where is Malvolio ?
He's coming , madam ; but he's acting very strangely .
He must be possessed by the devil .
Why , what's the matter with him ?
Is he talking nonsense ?
No , he just smiles .
You should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he's clearly disturbed .
Ask him in here .
I'm as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
What's going on , Malvolio ?
Hello , sweet lady .
Why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
He's a fool and a spendthrift .
You shouldn't talk about him like that !
Anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
Who said that ?
The same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
We only drink toasts to my niece .
I'll drink to her as long as there's a hole in my throat and booze in Illyria .
Anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
Sir Toby Belch !
How are you , Sir Toby Belch ?
Sweet Sir Andrew !
You're smiling ?
I sent for you about a sad occasion .
Sad , my lady !
I could be sad if I wanted to be .
These crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
As the sonnet says , "If you please one special person , you please everyone who matters." Why , what's going on ?
What's the matter with you ?
My legs may be yellow , but I don't feel blue .
It was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
I think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
Don't you think you should go to bed , Malvolio ?
To bed !
How are you feeling , Malvolio ?
You're asking me !
Noble people don't answer to peasants !
Why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
Don't be afraid of greatness." That was well written .
What do you mean by that , Malvolio ?
Some are born great , "
What ?
Some achieve greatness , " What are you saying ?
And some have greatness thrust upon them." Heaven help you !
Remember who liked your yellow stockings , " Your yellow stockings ?
And wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs." Crisscrossed ?
Go ahead .
Madam , Count Orsino's young messenger has returned .
I'll go to him .
Maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
Where's my cousin Toby ?
Have some of my servants take care of Malvolio .
I'd give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
Oh ho !
Look at me now !
This is just what the letter said .
Get rid of your low-class trapping , " she said .
I've got her now , but I've got God to thank for it !
And when she left just now , she said "Take care of this poor fellow here." Fellow ! " Not "Malvolio , " not anything referring to my low station in life , but "fellow." Everything's going perfectly .
Nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
Well , God is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
I don't care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , I still want to speak to him .
Here he is , here he is .
How are you , sir ?
Go away .
Let me enjoy my privacy .
Go away .
Ah-ha !
Does she ?
Do you even know what you're talking about ?
Sure thing , we'll do it tomorrow morning .
My lady would never want to lose him .
What are you saying , mistress ?
Oh , Lord !
Gentleness is the only way to go , gently , gently .
The devil inside him is rough , but we can't treat it roughly .
Sir !
Yes , dear little chick , come along with me. , Shut up , man !
You're serious enough to know not to play games with Satan .
Damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
Get him to say his prayers , Sir Toby , get him to pray .
My prayers , you hussy ?
Go hang yourselves , all of you !
You're all lazy and shallow .
I'm not like you .
You'll know more about it later .
Is it possible ?
If this were a play , I'd complain it was unrealistic .
He's really taken this prank to heart .
No , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
Wow , we're really going to drive him crazy .
The house will be so much quieter .
Come on , let's put him in a dark room and tie him up .
My niece already thinks he's insane .
Here's more insanity for us .
Is it that aggressive ?
Yes , it is , I think .
Just read it .
Give it to me .
That's a good thing to put in , it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
Nice and short and full of good sense , or should I say nonsense ?
Good .
You still haven't said anything incriminating .
Good .
Andrew Aguecheek"
If this letter doesn't make him fight , I don't know what will .
I'll give it to him .
You might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
He's conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he'll leave .
Go , Sir Andrew .
Look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff's deputy .
Now go !
Don't worry about me not swearing enough .
The fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece Olivia confirms this .
So this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn't going to scare him at all .
He'll just think an idiot wrote it .
But I'll deliver Sir Andrew's challenge by word of mouth , describing Sir Andrew as courageous in battle and convincing the young gentleman that Sir Andrew is furious , impetuous , and a skilled fighter ( he'll believe me because he's young ) .
This will make them both so afraid that they'll kill each other just by looking at each other .
Here comes the messenger with your niece .
Leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
Meanwhile , I'll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
My lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
Here , take this piece of jewelry .
There's a picture of me inside .
Don't refuse it .
It won't annoy you like me , because it doesn't have a voice .
And I beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
What could you possibly ask of me that I wouldn't give you , as long as it didn't damage my honor and self-respect ?
Nothing , except your true love for my lord .
How could I honorably give him what I've already given you ?
I'll give it back to you .
Just come again tomorrow .
Good-bye .
A devil like you could lead me to hell .
Hello , sir .
Hello to you .
You'd better think up a way to defend yourself .
I don't know what you've done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
Draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
There must be some mistake , sir .
I'm sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
I can't remember anything I've ever done to offend anyone .
You're wrong about that , I assure you .
But who is this person , sir ?
He's a knight .
He's killed three people , and he's so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
Fight to the death" is his motto .
Hello , sir .
Chat her up , Sir Andrew .
What ?
My dear Miss Chat-her-up , I look forward to getting to know you better .
My name is Mary , sir .
I was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
Is that really what you meant ?
If you let her go this easily , Sir Andrew , you don't deserve to ever use your sword again .
If you leave like this , my dear , I won't ever use my sword again .
Do you think you've got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
I'm not holding your hand , sir .
I'll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
I'm not a fighter .
I've heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
This man is probably like that .
No , sir .
He's furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
So go out there and give him what he wants .
You can't go back into the house unless you want to fight with me , and if you're willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
This is as rude as it is strange .
Please , do me this one favor : find out what I've done to offend this knight .
It must be something I did accidentally .
I will do so .
Mr. Fabian , stay with this gentleman until I come back .
Excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
What kind of man is he ?
He really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in Illyria .
Do you want to go see him ?
I'll try to calm him down for you if I can .
I'd be very grateful to you if you did .
Wow , he's a real devil .
I've never seen such a monster .
I had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can't even duck out of the way .
And when he strikes back at you , he'll hit you as sure as you're standing there .
They say he used to fence for the shah of Persia .
That's it !
I won't mess with him .
Yes , but now there's no way to calm him down .
Fabian can hardly control him over there .
Darn it , if I'd guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , I never would have challenged him .
I'll give him my gray horse Capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
I'll give it a try .
Stay right here and try to look good .
This may end without anyone getting killed .
He's just as terrified of Sir Andrew .
He's pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
Come on , Sir Andrew , there's nothing you can do about it .
The gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
The rules of dueling say he has to .
But as a gentleman and a soldier he's promised me he won't hurt you .
Come on , get ready .
I hope to God he keeps his promise !
I swear to you , I don't want to be doing this .
Put your sword away .
If this young gentleman has offended you , I'll take the blame for it .
If you've offended him , I'll fight you .
You , sir ?
Who are you ?
In fact , I'd do even more to him than what you've heard him promise to do .
If you're someone who gets into fights , I'll fight with you .
Oh , Sir Toby , stop !
The police are here .
I certainly will , sir .
And as for what I promised to you , I'm as good as my word .
You can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
This is the man .
Do your job .
Antonio , you're under arrest on the orders of Count Orsino .
You must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
No , sir , not at all .
I recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor's cap on your head. , Take him away .
He knows I recognize him .
I have to obey .
Don't worry about me .
Come on , sir , let's go .
What money , sir ?
Take this .
It's half of all my money .
Are you really going to pretend you don't know me now ?
I hate an ungrateful man more than I hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to. , Oh , my God !
Come on , sir , please .
Let's go .
Let's go !
But oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
Only really cruel people can be called deformed .
Virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
The man's going crazy .
Take him away .
Take me .
I don't believe it .
Yet I wish I could .
Oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
Come here , Sir Andrew .
You too , Fabian .
We've got some words of wisdom to mull over .
He called me Sebastian .
with the same accessories .
Oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
He's a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
He abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn't know him .
As for his cowardliness , ask Fabian .
He's a coward , a total coward .
By God , I'll go after him again and beat him up .
I swear I will , Come on , let's go see what happens .
I'll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
Leave me alone .
Good for you , holding out on me like this !
No , I don't know you , and my lady didn't send me to get you , and I'm not supposed to tell you to come speak with her , and your name is not Master Cesario , and this is not my nose , either .
Nothing is what it is .
Oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
You don't know me .
Blab my nonsense ?
He must've heard that phrase describing some great man and now he's using it on a jester .
Blab my nonsense !
What an idiotic place this world is .
Now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly I should blab to my lady .
Should I blab to her that you're coming ?
Please , fool , go away .
Here's money for you .
Well , well .
Wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation , if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
Stop right now or I'll throw your dagger over the roof .
No , leave him alone .
I'll get back at him another way .
I'll sue him for assault and battery , if there's any justice in Illyria .
It doesn't matter that I hit him first .
No , sir , I won't let you go .
Come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
You're awfully eager to fight .
Come on .
I'll get free of you .
What are you going to do now ?
If you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
What ?
Because then I'd have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
Stop , Sir Toby !
I order you to stop !
Madam !
Are you always going to be like this ?
Get out of my sight ! , Dear Cesario , please don't be offended. , Get out of here , you barbarian !
You have to come with me .
Please don't say no .
Damn that Toby !
He made my heart leap for you .
Why , sweetheart ?
Your hand is Well , I hope so .
I'm not such an idiot that I can't keep my hands dry .
But I don't get it , what's the joke ?
Just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
Are you always so funny ?
But oops , when I let go of your hand , I let go of the biggest joke of all .
Sir , you need a drink .
When has anyone ever put you down like that .
Never .
Sometimes I think I'm no smarter than average .
If this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
Come with me , please .
I wish you'd do what I ask !
Madam , I will .
Oh , say it , and mean it !
No , I'm telling you , put on this robe and beard .
Make him think you're Sir Topas the priest .
Be quick .
Meanwhile , I'll get Sir Toby .
Here come the conspirators .
God bless you , Mr .
Priest .
Go to him , Sir Topas .
The fool's a good actor .
A good fool .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas , good Sir Topas , please go find my lady Olivia , Get out , demon !
Why are you bothering this poor man !
Can't you talk about anything besides ladies ?
You should be ashamed of yourself , Satan , you liar !
I'm being gentle with you , because I'm one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
You call this house dark ?
Dark as hell , Sir Topas .
But it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
But you're still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
I'm not insane , Sir Topas .
I'm telling you , this house is dark .
You're wrong , you madman .
There's no darkness except ignorance , and you're more ignorant than the Egyptians during the plague of fog .
I tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
I'm no more insane than you are , and I'll prove it .
Ask me any commonsense question .
What was the philosopher Pythagoras's belief about wild birds ?
That our grandmother's soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
What do you think of his belief ?
I respect the soul very much , so I disagree with his belief .
Well then , goodbye .
Stay in the dark .
I'll only admit that you're sane when you agree with Pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother's soul .
Goodbye .
Sir Topas , Sir Topas !
The brilliant Sir Topas !
I can do anything !
You could've done this without your beard and gown .
He couldn't see you .
Now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
I wish this trick would be over .
I'm in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn't be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
Come to my room later on .
Fool !
Fool !
Fool , I say !
Good fool , good jester , I'll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
You have my word as a gentleman that I'll always be grateful to you .
Master Malvolio ?
Yes , good fool .
As sane as me ?
Then you really are insane , if you're no saner than a fool .
Sir Topas !
Fool , fool , hey , fool !
Please , sir , be quiet .
What do you want to say , sir ?
Be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
I tell you , I'm as sane as any man in Illyria .
If only you were , sir .
I swear I am .
Get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
You'll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
I'll help you .
But tell me honestly , are you sure you're not insane ?
Or are you just pretending ?
Believe me , I'm not .
I'm telling the truth .
I'll never believe a madman until I can see his brains .
But I'll get you a candle and paper and ink .
Fool , I'll repay you for this favor .
Please , hurry .
This is the air , that's the glorious sun .
Where's Antonio , then ?
I didn't find him at the Elephant .
But he'd been there before me , and they told me he'd gone out looking for me .
I could really use his advice right now .
There's something going on that's not what it seems .
But here she comes .
I'll follow the priest and go with you ; and after I've sworn to be faithful , I'll be faithful forever .
Then lead the way , father .
If you're my friend , you'll let me see his letter .
Dear Mr. Fabian , do me another favor first .
Anything .
Don't ask to see this letter .
My friends , are you all Lady Olivia's servants ?
Yes , sir , we're part of her entourage .
I know you .
How are you , my friend ?
I'm better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
You're better off because of your friends .
No , sir , worse off .
How can that be ?
By the way , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
What does You'd have a great hairstyle if you had .
Why , would that have fixed my hair ?
Oh , no question , it won't style itself .
But my hair looks good anyway , doesn't it ?
It looks great .
It hangs like an old worn-out mop .
Listen , I'm going home tomorrow , Sir Toby .
That duke who lives nearby is courting her .
I've heard her say that .
So cheer up , there's still hope for you , man .
Well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that I am an idiot .
My enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
So if four negatives make two affirmatives , I'm worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
That's excellent .
Don't say that , unless you want to be one of my friends .
That's a nice hand you dealt me .
But if it's not double-dealing , sir , I wish you'd deal me another .
Oh , you're a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
Well , I'll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
Here it is .
And maybe a third ?
The three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime , one , two , three .
You can't get any more money out of me right now .
If you tell your lady I'm here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
Well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it'll nap until I come back .
But don't think I'm doing this because I'm greedy .
I'll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
Here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
I remember his face well .
Though the last time I saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
He was the captain of a flimsy boat that was practically worthless because it was so small .
Orsino , this is the same Antonio who took the
But then he said strange things to me .
I don't know what else it could be .
But you're a famous pirate !
Orsino , sir , please don't call me those names .
I was never a thief or a pirate , though I admit I was your enemy for good reasons .
I rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
He was a wreck , almost past hope .
I saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
How is that possible ?
Ah , the countess is coming !
An angel is walking on earth .
What can I give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can't have ?
Cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
Madam ?
Dearest Olivia , What do you have to say for yourself , Cesario ? , My lord , please , My lord wants to speak .
It's my duty to be quiet .
Are you still so cruel ?
I am still so faithful , my lord .
What , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
I breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered , what more am I supposed to do ?
You can do whatever you want as long as it's socially appropriate .
Come with me , boy .
And I would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
Where's Cesario going ?
That's the truth .
Who tricked you ?
Who treated you badly ?
Have you completely forgotten ?
Has it been so long ?
Call the priest .
Go where , my lord ? , Cesario , my husband , stay here .
Husband ?
Yes , husband .
Can he deny it ?
Are you her husband , boy ?
No , my lord , not me .
But don't be afraid , Cesario .
Be the person you know you are , and you'll be as powerful as this person you fear .
Oh , hello , father !
Father , could I please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
My lord , I swear to you , Oh , don't swear !
Keep a little bit of honesty , even if you're afraid .
For the love of God , call a doctor !
Sir Toby needs help right away .
What's the matter ?
He cut my head and gave Sir Toby a bloody head , too .
For the love of God , help us !
I'd give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
Who did this , Sir Andrew ?
The count's messenger , Cesario .
We thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
My Cesario ?
Anything I did to you , I did it because Sir Toby made me .
Why are you talking like this ?
I never hurt you .
If a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
Apparently you think there's nothing unusual about a bloody head .
Here comes Sir Toby , limping .
He'll tell you more of the story .
If he hadn't been drunk , he would've really roughed you up .
Hello , sir !
How are you ?
It doesn't matter how I am : he hurt me , and that's that .
Oh , he's drunk , Sir Toby , for a whole hour now .
His eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
Then he's no good .
I hate no-good drunks .
Take him away !
Who did this to him ?
I'll help you , Sir Toby .
Will you help me ? , What an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
Get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
But please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
One face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
Antonio , oh my dear Antonio !
I've been so tortured since I lost track of you !
Are you Sebastian ?
Do you have any doubts , Antonio ?
How did you divide yourself in two ?
These two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
Which one is Sebastian ?
How unbelievable !
Sebastian was my father's name , and my brother was named Sebastian too .
I am a spirit , yes , since I have a soul .
If you were a woman , I'd hug you now and cry , and say "Welcome back , drowned Viola ! " My father had a mole on his forehead .
Mine did too .
He died on Viola's thirteenth birthday .
All right , I'll stay another month .
Ah , I'm an odd kind of guy .
Sometimes all I want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
Are you good at those kinds of things ?
Why do you hide these things ?
Why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
Are they likely to get dusty ?
Why don't you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
I wouldn't even pee without dancing a waltz .
What are you thinking ?
Is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
Look how shapely your legs are .
That's true .
Why not ?
Weren't we both born under Taurus ?
Oh , I remember that very clearly !
It's true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
Give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman's clothing .
The captain who brought me to shore has my women's clothes .
For some reason he's in prison now on some legal technicality , on Malvolio's orders .
He'll release him .
I was so crazy myself that I forgot all about him .
Well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
He's written you a letter .
I would've given it to you this morning , but a madman's letters aren't Gospel , so it doesn't matter much if I'm a bit late .
Open it and read it .
There's a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
Why are you talking like that ?
Are you insane ?
No , madam , I'm just reading an insane letter .
If you want things done in the right way , you'll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
No , please , read it like a sane person .
I will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
So listen up , princess .
I swear to God , madam , you've wronged me , and I'll tell the whole world .
You've shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but I'm as sane as you are .
I don't care what you think of me .
I'm going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you've caused me .
Signed , The poorly treated Malvolio." Did he write this ?
Yes , madam .
Set him free .
Fabian , bring him here .
I accept that offer happily , madam .
Is this the madman ?
Yes , my lord .
How are you , Malvolio ?
Madam , you've treated me badly , very badly .
I did , Malvolio ?
No .
Tell me why you did it .
I'm sorry , Malvolio , but this isn't my writing , though I admit it looks like mine .
It's definitely Maria's handwriting .
Now that I think about it , Maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
I promise .
Well , you know , "some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them." Anyway , I was part of the trick , sir .
He really was tricked horribly .
Go after him and try to calm him down a little .
He still hasn't told us about the captain .
Cesario , come here .
Taurus !
That governs the torso and heart , doesn't it ?
No , the legs and thighs .
Let me see you dance .
He's only known you for three days , but he's already treating you like a close friend .
No , not at all .
Thanks for telling me .
Here comes the Duke now .
Has anyone seen Cesario ?
Be loud and obnoxious .
I don't think so , my lord .
My boy , it's true .
Anyone who says you're a man must not notice how young you are .
I know you're the right person for this job .
I'll do my best to make this lady love you .
Give me too much of it , so I'll get sick of it and stop loving .
Oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
It doesn't sound as sweet as it did before .
Love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
Do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
Hunting what , Curio ?
Lady Olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
So let her execute me .
How do you know ?
Well , he'll be dead , so he won't see anything .
That's a lame answer .
Where , good Miss Mary ?
From soldiers .
Well , we all have our special gifts .
But still , she's going to kill you for being gone so long .
You've made up your mind , then ?
Well , go along now .
You'd be the funniest person in Illyria, if Sir Toby ever stopped drinking .
Shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
Here comes my lady .
Get that fool out of here .
Didn't you hear her , guys ?
Get the lady out of here .
Oh , go away , you're a boring fool .
I don't want to have anything to do with you anymore .
Besides , you've gotten unreliable .
If he can not , let the tailor mend him .
Anything that's mended is only patched up .
A good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
If this logic works , that's great .
If not , what can you do about it ?
I told them to take Oh , what a big mistake !
Please let me prove you're a fool .
Can you do that ?
Easily , madam .
I'll have to ask you some questions , madam .
Please answer , my good little student .
I'm listening to you only because I've got nothing better to do .
My dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
My dear fool , because my brother died .
I think his soul's in hell , my lady .
I know his soul's in heaven , fool .
Then you're a fool for being sad that your brother's soul is in heaven .
Take away this fool , gentlemen .
What do you think of this fool , Malvolio ?
Isn't he getting funnier ?
Yes , and he'll keep getting funnier till he dies .
Old age always makes people act funny , even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
I hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
Sir Toby would bet a fortune that I'm not smart , but he wouldn't bet two cents that you're not a fool .
What do you say to that , Malvolio ?
I'm surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
The other day I saw him defeated in a
I swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester's apprentice .
Malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
You speak so highly of fools !
Madam , there's a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
Was he sent by Count Orsino ?
I don't know , madam .
He's a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
Who's talking to him now ?
Sir Toby , madam , your relative .
He talks nothing but nonsense .
If he's got a message from the count , tell him I'm sick , or not home .
Who's that at the gate , uncle ?
A gentleman .
A gentleman ?
What gentleman ?
There's some gentleman out there. , Good Sir Toby !
Nonsense .
I defy brain-death !
I told you , someone's at the gate .
Yes , but who is he ?
Let him be the devil if he wants to , I don't care .
God will protect me .
Tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
He's a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
The first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
Go take care of him .
Madam , that young man out there says he's got to speak to you .
I told him you were sick .
He claimed he knew that , and that's why he's come to speak with you .
I told him you were asleep .
He claimed to know that already too , and said that's the reason he's come to speak with you .
What can I say to him , lady ?
He's got an answer for everything .
Tell him he's not going to speak with me .
Just a man , like any other .
But what's he like ?
He insists he'll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
How old is he ?
Not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
He's somewhere between boy and man .
He's very handsome and speaks well , but he's very young .
He looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
Show him in .
Call in my maid .
Maria , our lady wants you .
Give me my veil .
Come , put it over my face .
Which one of you is the lady of the house ?
You can speak to me .
I represent her .
What do you want ?
What stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty , but please , tell me if you're the lady of the house , because I've never seen her .
I'd hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because It's very well written and I spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
Beautiful ladies , please don't treat me badly .
I'm very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
Where do you come from , sir ?
I'm sorry , but I memorized what I'm supposed to say here today , and that question isn't part of the speech I learned .
Please , my lady , just confirm that you're the lady of the house so I can get on with my speech .
Are you an actor ?
No , madam .
But I swear I'm not the person I'm playing .
Are you the lady of the house ?
I am , unless I somehow stole this role .
If you're the lady of the house , then it's true you're stealing your role , because what's yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
But that's not part of what I'm supposed to say .
I'll go on with my speech praising you , and then I'll get to the point .
Get to the point now .
I'll let you get away with skipping the praise .
That's too bad , because I spent a long time memorizing it , and it's poetic .
That means it's more likely to be fake .
Please , keep it to yourself .
If you're just insane , then get out of here .
Ready to set sail , sir ?
The door's right here .
Tell me what you want .
Tell me what it's about .
It's about you .
I'm not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
I'm coming in peace .
But you began so rudely .
Who are you ?
What do you want ?
What's going on ?
What have you heard from her ?
Take me to the garden .
Who I am and what I want are a secret .
Everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
Most sweet lady , Oh , "sweet" !
Where's the passage of holy scripture that you're basing your sermon on ?
In Orsino's heart .
In his heart ?
In what chapter and verse of his heart ?
The table of contents says it's in the first chapter of his heart .
Oh , I've read that .
That's not holy , it's heresy .
Do you have anything else to say ?
Madam , please let me see your face .
Has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
You're overstepping your bounds now .
But I'll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
Look , sir , this is a portrait of me as I am at this particular moment .
It's pretty well done , isn't it ?
Wind and rain can't wash it off .
Oh , I'd never be that cruel .
I'll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
But you'd still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
My lord loves you .
How does he love me ?
Your lord knows what I think .
I can't love him .
I know he's noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
People say he's generous , well educated , and brave , and he's very attractive .
But I just can't love him .
What would you do about it ?
From that cabin I'd call out to my soul .
I'd write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
Not bad ; you might accomplish something .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
I'm a gentleman .
Go back to your lord .
I can't love him .
Tell him not to send any more messengers , unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
Goodbye .
Thanks for your trouble .
Here's some money for you .
I'm not a paid messenger , my lady .
Keep your money .
It's my master who's not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
Goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
But I'm still fairly high-ranking .
Ah , no .
Calm down , calm down .
If only his lord were more like him .
How strange I'm feeling !
Can someone fall in love this quickly ?
Come here !
At your service , madam .
Run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke's servant .
He insisted on leaving this ring with me whether I wanted it or not .
Madam , I will .
I don't know what I'm doing .
Fate , do your work .
We human beings don't control our own destinies .
What is fated to happen must happen .
No , I'd rather you stayed here .
At least tell me where you're going .
Honestly , I can't .
I'm just wandering , with no particular destination .
But I know you'd never force me to tell you things I don't want to , so I should be polite and tell you what I can .
He left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
If God had been willing , I wish we had died in the same hour too !
An hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
How tragic !
Although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
She's been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
Oh , Antonio , I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble .
Please let me be your servant so I can be with you .
I like you very much .
I'm going to Count Orsino's court .
Goodbye .
I wish you all the best .
If I didn't have so many enemies in Orsino's court , I'd go join you there .
But who cares .
Excuse me , weren't you with Countess Olivia just now ?
Yes , sir .
I've only made it this far since I left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
She's sending this ring back to you , sir .
You should've saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
Here , take the ring .
She took that ring from me .
I won't take it back .
You threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
I didn't give her any ring .
What's she trying to say ?
I hope she doesn't have a crush on me !
It's true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn't really finish her sentences very well .
Oh , I really think she loves me !
creet .
I'm the man she wants .
If that's true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
Ah , how will this all turn out ?
What can possibly fix this situation ?
Oh , only time can sort out this mess .
I can't figure it out by myself !
Come on , Sir Andrew .
And the doctors say it's healthy to get up early , I don't know what the doctors say .
All I know is that staying up late is staying up late .
A false conclusion .
I hate your logic as much as I hate an empty drinking cup .
You're a smart guy .
So we should eat and drink .
Maria !
Bring us some wine !
Look , here comes the fool .
Hello , my friends !
What a pretty picture , three fools all together .
Hello , you idiot .
Sing us a song .
What country is this , friends ?
This is Illyria , lady .
And what am I supposed to do in Illyria ?
My brother is in heaven .
Or maybe there's a chance he didn't drown. , What do you think , sailors ?
It was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
Oh , my poor brother !
But maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
It's possible , ma'am .
Don't give up yet .
I was born and raised less than three hours from here .
I swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
My girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren't Ha , ha !
Would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
A love song , a love song .
Yes , yes .
I'm not interested in being good .
That was excellent , really excellent .
Good , very good .
A beautiful voice , I swear .
His breath stinks .
Yes , it stinks very sweetly .
Should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
Should we do that ?
Let's go for it .
Absolutely .
Let's dance to "You Jerk." You mean , "Shut up , you jerk" ?
So I'll be forced to call you a jerk , Sir Andrew .
It starts , "Shut up." I'll never be able to start if I shut up .
That's true .
But come on , start .
You're making a terrible racket out here !
Lady Olivia told her servant Malvolio to kick you out of the house .
For God's sake , shut up !
Are you all crazy ?
What's wrong with you ?
Are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you're just stupid ?
Don't you have any respect for anything ?
We respected the beat of the song , sir .
So shut up !
Sir Toby , I've got to be frank with you .
My lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you're a relative , she doesn't approve of your behavior .
If you can shape up , you're welcome to stay in the house .
If you can't , and would prefer to leave , she's very willing to say goodbye to you .
No , good Sir Toby .
That's out of tune , sir .
You lie .
They certainly will .
You're right .
Go and wiggle your ears !
I could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
Do that .
I'll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
Or I'll deliver your insults to his face .
Dear Sir Toby , don't do anything rash tonight .
Ever since the Duke's messenger visited Olivia , she's been upset .
As for Monsieur Malvolio , let me take care of him .
I know I can do it .
Oh , I'll beat him up for that !
I don't have any "brilliant" reason for it , but I have a good enough reason .
That's the weakness I'll use to get revenge on him .
What are you going to do ?
I can make my handwriting look just like Lady Olivia's : she
Excellent !
I like it too .
He'll think these letters are from Olivia and that she's in love with him .
Yes , that's the idea .
He's going to look like a total idiot .
Absolutely , you idiot .
This is going to be great !
It's going to be fun , I promise .
I know my medicine will work on him .
I'll have you two hide , and the fool too , right where he'll find the letter .
Watch his reaction .
Meanwhile , let's go to bed and dream about this .
Good night .
Good night , you amazing woman , you .
She's a fine woman , all right .
She's a good little woman , and she adores me .
What about it ?
Someone adored me once , too .
Let's go to bed , knight .
Tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
I know I will too , if it's the last thing I do .
It's too late to go to bed now .
Play me some music .
Sir , the person who should sing that song isn't here .
Who was it ?
He's somewhere else in the house .
You're absolutely right .
I'd bet my life that , as young as you are , you've fallen in love with someone .
Haven't you , boy ?
A little bit .
What kind of woman is she ?
She's a lot like you .
She's not good enough for you , then .
How old is she ?
About as old as you are , my lord .
That's definitely too old .
A woman should always pick an older man .
I think you're right , sir .
So find someone younger to love , or you won't be able to maintain your feelings .
Women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it's about to decay .
That's true .
It's too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
Who's the ruler here ?
A duke who is noble in name and character .
What's his name ?
Orsino .
Orsino .
I've heard my father mention him .
When I first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
But there was a rumor , you know , people always gossip about royalty , that he was in love with the beautiful Olivia .
Who's she ?
I wish I could work for that lady !
Are you ready , sir ?
No trouble , sir .
I like singing .
Then I'll pay you for doing what you like .
You may leave .
Goodbye .
All the rest of you can leave too .
Cesario , go visit that cruel Olivia one more time .
Tell her my love is purer than anything else in the whole world , and has nothing to do with her property .
But if she can't love you , sir ?
I refuse to accept that .
But you have to .
Just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love Olivia .
Shouldn't she just accept that ?
No woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion I feel .
No woman's heart is big enough to hold all my love .
They eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
It's as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
Don't compare a woman's love for a man with my love for Olivia .
Yes , but I know , What do you know ?
I know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
Actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
My father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that I might love you , if I were a woman .
And what's her story ?
There was no story , my lord .
Doesn't that sound like true love ?
But did your sister die of love ?
I am the only daughter in my father's family , and all the brothers too , but I'm not completely sure about that .
Anyway , sir , should I go see the lady ?
Come along with us , Signor Fabian .
I'm coming , don't worry .
If I miss this , let me be boiled alive .
Won't you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
I'll be thrilled .
You know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when I arranged a bear-baiting here .
We'll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we'll mock him till he's black and blue .
Won't we , Sir Andrew ?
If we don't , it'll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
Here comes the little villain herself .
How are you , my golden girl ?
Hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
Malvolio's coming down the path .
He's been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
This letter's going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
