I have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
But if Antony is alive , healthy , friendly with Caesar , and not Caesar's prisoner , I'll shower you with gold and pearls .
Madam , he's well .
That's well spoken .
And he's friendly with Caesar .
You are an honest man .
Caesar and he are better friends than ever .
I'm going to make you a rich man .
But yet , madam , I don't like the sound of "but yet." It reverses all the good that came before it .
Damn those words , "but yet ! " "But yet" is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal .
Please , my friend , give me all the news , both good and bad , at the same time .
You say he's friendly with Caesar , healthy , and free .
I didn't say free , madam .
No , I didn't say that .
He's bound to Octavia .
For what favor ?
For the favor of sleeping in her bed .
I'm sick , Charmian .
He's married to Octavia , madam .
May you die of the worst disease !
Good madam , be patient .
What did you say to me ?
Get out , you horrible bastard , or I'll gouge out your eyes .
I'll scalp you .
I'll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
If you say it isn't true , I'll give you a province and make you rich .
The blows I gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
He's married , madam .
Rogue , you've lived too long !
No way , then , I'll run .
What's the matter with you , madam ?
I haven't done anything to you .
Good madam , restrain yourself .
The man hasn't done anything wrong .
Even innocents can not always escape disaster .
May Egypt drown in the Nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
Call that servant back .
Even though I'm mad , I won't bite him .
Call him !
He's afraid to come in .
I won't hurt him .
My hands are tainted if they hit an inferior , especially since I myself am the cause of my own distress .
Come here , sir .
It may be honest , but it's never wise to bring bad news .
You can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
I've only done my duty .
Is he married ?
May the gods destroy you !
Do you maintain the same story ?
Do you want me to lie , madam ?
Go , get out !
Even if you were as handsome as I beg your highness' pardon .
Is he really married ?
Please don't be offended that I don't want to offend you any more .
It's not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
He's married to Octavia .
It's too bad that Antony's fault should make you look like a jerk .
Go away .
The merchandise you bring from Rome is too expensive for me .
Let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
Be patient , your highness .
When I have praised Antony , I've disparaged Caesar .
Many times , madam .
I'm being repaid for that now .
Help me out of here .
Oh , Iras , Charmian !
It doesn't matter .
How old is she ?
Don't let him leave out the color of her hair .
Bring me his answers quickly .
Even though half of him is like a
Lord Alexas , sweet Alexas , most anything Alexas , almost the most consummate Alexas , where's the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the Queen ?
Oh , I only wish I knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife !
I don't make fortunes ; I only see them .
Then see a good one for me .
No , he means you'll use makeup when you're old .
May my wrinkles forbid that !
Don't joke about his predictions .
Pay attention .
Quiet !
You will love more than you are loved .
It's proper that we speak first , which is why we sent our proposals ahead of us for your consideration .
Why did Cassius conspire against Caesar ?
Take your time .
Pompey , you can not frighten us with your navy .
We'll meet you at sea .
Yes , on land you do outnumber me .
Even more since you annexed my father's house and lands .
But since , To get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
That's the point .
Don't let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
You have offered me the lands of Sicily and Sardinia .
In return , I must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to Rome .
If I agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
That's our offer .
You should know that when I came here I was prepared to accept your offer .
Let me shake your hand .
I didn't think I would see you here .
The East is very seductive .
Well , I can not tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but I will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
It's good we had this meeting .
I hope it works out for the best , Lepidus .
So we are in agreement .
That's the next thing on the agenda .
We'll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
I'll give the first one , Pompey .
No , Antony .
Whether your banquet is first or last , your Egyptian cooking will make it the best .
I heard that Julius Caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
You've heard a lot .
I mean well , sir .
I'm sure you do .
I've heard a lot more .
I heard that Apollodorus carried , What did he carry , please ?
How are you , soldier ?
I'm well , and probably will be for a while , as I hear that four feasts are being prepared .
Let me shake your hand .
I've never been your enemy .
I've seen you fight and envied your skill .
Sir , I wouldn't say I was your friend , but I've praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than I gave .
Enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
I invite you all aboard my ship .
After you , my lords ?
Show us the way , sir .
Come with me .
I think it was at sea .
That it was , sir .
You've done well at sea .
And you've done well on land .
I'll flatter anyone who flatters me , though what I've accomplished on land can not be denied .
Neither can my accomplishments at sea .
Yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
As you were on land .
That's the one part of my service on land I do deny .
But let's shake hands , Menas .
If our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we're embracing .
Men's faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
But no beautiful woman has an honest face .
That's no lie .
They steal hearts .
We came here to fight against you .
For my part , I'm sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
Today Pompey laughs away his fortune .
If that's true , he won't get it back by crying .
That's the truth , sir .
We didn't expect Mark Antony to be here .
Is he married to Cleopatra ?
Caesar's sister is named Octavia .
That's true , sir .
She was previously Caius Marcellus' wife .
But she is now Mark Antony's wife .
Excuse me , sir ?
It's true .
Then Caesar and he will always be united .
If I were to make a prediction regarding this union , I wouldn't say that .
I think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
I think so too .
But you'll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
Octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
Doesn't everyone want a wife like that ?
Not someone who doesn't share that disposition , meaning Mark Antony .
He'll go back to his Egyptian dish .
Then Octavia's complaints will rouse Caesar , and as I said before , the thing that brought them together will part them .
Antony will go where his passion is .
He only married out of political necessity .
Then that's the way it may turn out .
Come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
I want to drink your health .
I'll join you , sir .
We did a lot of drinking in Egypt .
Let's go .
Here's where they'll end up , on the floor .
Some of them are leaning already .
Lepidus is red in the face .
They made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
I'd rather carry a reed that obviously can't protect me than a sword I can not lift .
This is how they do it , sir : they measure the depth of the Nile , according to certain marks made on the walls of the Pyramid .
They know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
The higher the Nile flows , the better the harvest .
The harvest comes shortly after that .
Do you have unusual snakes there ?
Yes , Lepidus .
The Egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the Nile mud , just like the crocodile .
I don't feel so well , but I won't stop .
Not until you pass out .
I'm afraid you'll keep going until then .
I've heard that the pyramids build by the Ptolemies are splendid .
Without doubt I've heard that .
What does a crocodile look like ?
Sir , it's shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
It is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
Its own color .
It's a strange snake .
It is that .
And its tears are wet .
What is it ?
I've always had great respect for your destiny .
You've served me faithfully .
What else can I say ?
What are you saying ?
Would you like to be king of the entire world ?
Now I've said it twice .
How could that happen ?
Just listen to him .
Be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
Tell me that I'll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
Oh , excellent !
Then my children will probably be illegitimate .
Tell me , please : how many boys and girls will I have ?
If every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
You seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
We'll all want our fortune told .
My fortune , like that of many of us tonight , is to go drunk to bed .
Are you drunk ?
No , Pompey , I haven't had anything to drink .
Tell me how .
The three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
Everything that belongs to them is yours .
Oh , you should have done it without telling me !
For you to do it would be good service .
You should know that to me , profit isn't more important than honor , but the other way around .
Regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
But now I must condemn it .
Give it up and go drink .
This toast is for Lepidus !
Here's to you , Menas .
I accept with thanks , Enobarbus .
There goes a strong fellow , Menas .
Why do you say that ?
He carries a third of the world .
Can't you see that ?
Then a third of the world is drunk .
Drink up .
All right , then .
This hasn't reached the level of an Egyptian feast yet .
It's getting there .
Clink your cups together in a toast !
Here's to Caesar .
I could do without another toast .
Live in the moment .
But I would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
Let's have one , good soldier .
Come , let's join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
Everyone join hands .
How can you top that ?
Good night , Pompey .
Yes , we will .
Let's shake on it .
We're friends !
Come , this way to the rowboat .
Be careful not to fall in .
Menas , I'm not going back on shore .
No , come to my cabin .
What do you say ?
There's my hat !
Hooray !
Come on , noble captain .
Now I've paid you back , Parthia , and gotten revenge for Marcus Crassus' death .
You must understand , Silius , that it's better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior's absence .
Caesar and Antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .
A man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain's rival .
I could do more to help Antony , but to do so would insult him .
A soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , Ventidius .
Are you going to write Antony about this ?
I'll write how , under his flag and with his well-paid troops , we have beaten the formerly unvanquished Parthia .
Where's Antony now ?
Did the brothers-in-law leave ?
They finished their business with Pompey , and Pompey has left .
Octavia weeps at the thought of leaving Rome .
Caesar is in a sober mood .
He's a stylish man .
And how he loves Caesar !
Yes , but how he adores Mark Antony !
Caesar ?
Then what's Antony ?
A god of a god ?
Are you talking about Caesar ?
He's without equal !
Oh , Antony !
Oh , you If you want to praise Caesar , just say his name , that's all the praise that's necessary .
He certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
He loves Caesar best , but he also loves Antony .
Oh !
Hearts can not think it , tongues can not speak it , meas-urements can not calculate it , scribes can not write it , bards can not sing it , and poets can not make verses about it .
He loves them both .
They are his dung , and he their beetle .
So , there's the signal to ride .
Good-bye , noble Agrippa .
Good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
You can't go any further with us , sir .
If you and I don't value her equally , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her .
Don't insult me with your distrust .
I mean what I say .
You won't find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
So , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the Romans so that they turn and give you their support .
We'll leave you here .
Good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
I hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
Farewell .
My noble brother !
Her eyes are like April : full of showers .
What is it , Octavia ?
I'll tell you privately .
See , now I have you .
And thus I let you go and give you to the gods .
Good-bye .
Be happy .
Farewell , farewell .
Farewell .
Like the Oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
You can't see the future .
Well , if a moist palm isn't a clear sign of promiscuity , then I can't scratch my own ear .
Your fortunes are the same .
But how ?
Give me details .
I've said what I have to say .
Isn't my fortune just a little better than hers ?
Well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement ?
Not in my husband's nose .
May heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
Alexas !
If it's sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it's a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who's faithful .
Therefore , dear Isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
Where is that messenger ?
He's afraid to come in .
Oh , come on. , Come here , sir .
Gracious Queen , even Herod of Judea wouldn't dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
I'll have Herod's head chopped off !
Most formidable Queen !
Did you see Octavia ?
Yes , revered Queen .
Where ?
In Rome , Madam .
I saw her face as she walked with her brother and Mark Antony .
Is she as tall as I am ?
She is not , madam .
Did you hear her speak ?
Is her voice pitched high or low ?
Madam , I heard her speak .
She has a low-pitched voice .
That's not in her favor .
He can't like her very long .
Like her ?
Oh , Isis , that's impossible .
You're right , Charmian .
She creeps along .
She has a body , not a life .
Is this true ?
If not , then I have no powers of observation .
There aren't three people in all of Egypt who could do better .
She doesn't have anything going for her so far .
This messenger is wise .
Very wise .
Do you hear that , Charmian ?
And I think she's at least thirty .
Do you remember her face ?
Was it long or round ?
Round enough to be unattractive .
Usually that means a person is foolish .
What color is her hair ?
Brown , madam , and she wouldn't want her forehead to be any lower .
You mustn't hold my earlier outburst against me .
I'll hire you again to go back to Rome .
My letters are ready to go .
He's an admirable man .
He certainly is .
I'm very sorry I was so hard on him .
Not a bit , madam .
Everything may still be all right .
I assure you it is , madam .
Oh , dear husband , don't believe everything you hear , or if you must believe it , don't let it all make you angry .
No lady could be more miserable than I if you two disagree .
Gentle Octavia , support the one that supports you .
In the meantime , I'll raise an army that will surpass his .
May the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
When you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
Order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
How goes it , friend Eros ?
Some startling news has just arrived , sir .
What news , man ?
Caesar and Lepidus declared war against Pompey .
That's old news .
Who's winning ?
So the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
And even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them , they'll battle each other to the death to have it all .
Where's Antony ?
Another thing , Domitius : Antony wants to see you now .
I should have waited to tell you my news .
But never mind .
Take me to Antony .
Come with me , sir .
In Alexandria he condemned Rome , and that's not all .
This is what happened : he and Cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace .
He did this in public ?
He gave Syria , Cilicia , and Phoenicia to Ptolemy .
Let's send this news to Rome .
The Roman people are fed up with his arrogance already .
The people have heard it already , and they've been told of his accusations .
Who does he accuse ?
He accuses me of withholding his share of Sextus Pompeius' possessions , which we seized in Sicily .
Then he says I didn't return some ships he loaned me .
Sir , these accusations should be answered .
It has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
I answered that Lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
He'll never agree to that .
Then we won't agree to his demands .
Greetings , Caesar , my lord !
Greetings , dearest Caesar !
Oh , to think you've been rejected !
You've never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
Then why did you travel so quietly ?
You didn't arrive like Caesar's sister .
Antony's wife should have an army to escort her , with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears .
The dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
I would have met you by sea and again by land .
Mark Antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
Which he quickly allowed , given that you're an obstacle to his lust .
Amen .
Quiet !
Here comes Antony .
Have you seen my lord ?
No , lady .
Wasn't he here ?
No , madam .
He was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of Rome .
Madam ?
Here , at your service .
Here comes my lord .
Your wife , Fulvia , mustered her army first .
Against my brother Lucius ?
Yes .
Don't say that , my lord .
Where do you think he is now ?
He's in Athens , my lord .
No , he's not .
Cleopatra summoned him .
He's given his empire to a whore , and now they're gathering kings to wage a war .
He's recruited Bocchus , the King of Libya ; Archelaus of Cappadocia ; Philadelphos , King of Paphlagonia ; the Thracian king , Adallas ; King Manchus of Arabia ; the King of Pont ; Herod , of Judea ; Mithridates , King of Comagen ; Polemon and Amyntas , the kings of Mede and Lycaonia , and many more .
I'm divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other .
You're welcome here .
I didn't write about breaking the alliance with Antony until I saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations .
Cheer yourself .
You will always be welcome to me .
Welcome , lady .
Welcome , dear madam .
Every heart in Rome loves and pities you .
Only the adulterous and abominable Antony abandons you , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us .
It's undeniable .
You are welcome here , sister .
I beg you to continue to be patient .
My dearest sister !
But why , why , why ?
You opposed my taking part in the war .
Isn't this war against me ?
Why shouldn't I be there in person ?
What do you mean ?
Let Rome fall !
May the tongues of our critics rot !
I have responsibilities in this war , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom I will carry out my duties as if I were a man .
Don't argue against it .
I won't stay behind .
No , I've had my say .
Here comes the Emperor .
Isn't it strange , Canidius , that he could cross the Ionian Sea so quickly from Tarentum and Brundusium and take Toryne ? , Have you heard about this , sweet ?
No one admires speed more than the lazy .
What else ?
Why do you want to do that , my lord ?
Because he's daring us to do it .
So you've dared him to single combat .
Yes , and you dared Caesar to fight the battle at Pharsalia , where he fought against Pompey .
But Caesar ignores offers that don't give him an advantage , and so should you .
His ships are maneuverable .
Yours are slow and awkward .
Refusing to fight him at sea won't disgrace you .
I'll fight at sea .
Even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
What's your business ?
The news is true , my lord .
He has captured Toryne .
Canidius , take our nineteen
What's the news , brave soldier ?
Oh , don't fight by sea , noble Emperor !
Don't trust rotten planks .
Don't you trust my sword and these wounds ?
Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians go swimming .
We are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
Well , well , let's go .
By Hercules , I think I'm right .
Soldier , you are .
Our leader is being led .
On land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don't you ?
Marcus Octavius , Marcus Justeius , Publicola , and Caelius will go by sea , but we'll keep the bulk on land .
Caesar's speed defies belief .
While he was still in Rome , he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled .
Who's his lieutenant , do you know ?
A man named Taurus , they say .
I know the man well .
The Emperor is calling for Canidius .
The present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
Taurus !
My lord ?
Don't attack by land .
Don't provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
Our fate depends on this chance .
Assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of Caesar's navy .
I can't watch any more .
The Egyptian flagship , the Gods and goddesses , the whole congregation of them !
What's wrong with you ?
We have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
We have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
How goes the battle ?
Right in the middle of the fight , just when the battle could have gone either way , actually we had a slight advantage , that immoral Egyptian nag , May she die of leprosy ! , suddenly became frightened , and turned her ships around and fled .
I saw that .
The sight made me so sick I couldn't watch any more .
Well , give me the worst news .
The bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
Only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
Go on .
As far as I'm concerned , what's past is done .
It's like this : as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , I will listen as though he praised me .
Oh , my lord !
Speak plainly .
Call Cleopatra what the Romans call her .
It's easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
Good-bye for a while .
I never saw such a shameful act .
Terrible .
Terrible .
The battle on the sea is almost lost .
If our general had been his old self , we would have won .
Oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
Are you considering desertion , as well ?
Then everything must really be finished .
They fled toward Peloponnesus .
I'll yield my legions and cavalry to Caesar .
Listen .
Friends , come here .
I'm completely lost .
I have a ship full of treasure .
Escape and make peace with Caesar .
Flee ?
Not us .
I've told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
Friends , go .
I've decided on a plan that doesn't require your assistance .
Leave .
Oh , I followed something I'm ashamed to look at now !
Even my hair revolts .
Friends , go .
I'll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
Please , don't be sad , and don't tell me how reluctant you are .
Take your cues from my own despair .
Abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
Go to the harbor immediately !
I'll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
Just give me a moment , please , only a moment .
I've relinquished my authority , so please , I'll see you all before long .
What else ?
Let me sit down .
Oh , damn , damn , damn !
Madam !
Madam , oh , good Empress !
The Queen is here , my lord .
Go to him , madam , speak to him .
He's not himself because he feels so ashamed .
Well , then , help me .
Most noble sir , stand up .
The Queen is coming .
She's weak and will die unless you comfort her .
I've destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
Sir , here's the Queen .
Oh , where have you led me , Egypt ?
Oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
I didn't think you would follow me .
Queen , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .
You knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that I would ignore the gods' orders in favor of yours .
Oh , forgive me !
Now I will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
You knew that my sword , weakened by my love for you , would obey that love no matter what .
Don't shed even one tear .
One of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
Give me a kiss .
This repays me .
Let the envoy from Antony come in .
Do you know him ?
Come forward and speak .
Humble as I am , I represent Antony .
Until recently , I was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
So be it .
Say what you're here for .
If that is not granted , he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in Athens .
That's all he asks for himself .
Cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
As for Antony , I'm not interested in his requests .
I'll give the Queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of Egypt or kills him .
Then I'll listen to her .
Give my answer to them both .
May good luck follow you !
Take him safely through the lines .
I go , Caesar .
Observe how Antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
I will , Caesar .
What are we going to do , Enobarbus ?
Think about our situation , then die .
Who is to blame for this : Antony or I ?
Only Antony was at fault .
Why should he have followed you ?
With half the world opposing the other half , it wasn't the time for Antony , the pivotal player , to let love distract him .
To race after your departing ships , leaving his navy to watch , was a shame as great as the resulting loss .
Please , let's not talk about it .
Is that his answer ?
Yes , my lord .
The Queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
That's what he says .
Tell her .
Your head , my lord ?
A messenger has arrived from Caesar .
With no more ceremony than that ?
See , ladies , how they scorn me now .
I'll be at your service .
He's waiting outside .
What's your message ?
Your wife , Fulvia , is dead .
Where did she die ?
In Sicyon .
In this letter you'll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
Leave me .
What does Caesar want ?
It is for your ears only .
There are only friends here .
Speak confidently .
So they are possibly Antony's friends .
Sir , he should have as many as Caesar has .
If Caesar chose , Antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
As for us , you know we are Antony's , and he is Caesar's .
Just remember that he is Caesar .
He knows that you didn't embrace Antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
Oh !
He is like a god and knows the truth .
My honor wasn't given ; it was only dominated .
Shall I tell Caesar what you request from him ?
He almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
It would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
But he would feel even better if I could tell him that you had left Antony and put yourself under his protection .
What's your name ?
My name is Thidias .
Most kind messenger , tell great Caesar that through his deputy I kiss his conquering hand .
Tell him I am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
Promising favors ?
By Jove that thunders !
Who are you , slave ?
You will be whipped .
Take away this lout and whip him .
By the moon and stars !
Whip him !
If I saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to Caesar taking such liberties with her hand , what's her name now ?
Whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
Take him away .
Caesar's knave will bring him a message for us .
My good lord , You've always been a liar .
But when our vices become habits , Oh , the sadness of it ! , the wise gods blind us , shade our better judgment , make us love our mistakes , and laugh as we strut to our ruin .
Oh , has it come to this ?
You were a cold crumb on dead Julius Caesar's plate when I met you .
No , you were one of Gneius Pompey's leftovers , not to mention your other , more depraved affairs , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip .
For I'm sure that although you may know what temperance is , you've never experienced it firsthand .
Why are you doing this ?
Soundly , my lord .
Did he cry ?
Did he beg my pardon ?
He did ask for mercy .
Are you done yet ?
You , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
In order to flatter Caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
Don't you know me still ?
Has your heart cooled toward me ?
Ah , dear , if that is true , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat .
As it dissolves , so shall my life .
The next hailstone should hit Caesarion , until one by one all my children , and every one of my brave Egyptians , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied , covered by gnats and flies .
I am satisfied .
I will fight him there .
Our land forces have bravely stood firm .
Our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
Where have you been , my bravery ?
Do you hear what I say , lady ?
If I come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips , I'll be covered in blood .
My sword and I will earn our place in history .
We still have hope .
That's my brave lord !
I'll fight brutally .
But now I'll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
Come , let's have one more extravagant night .
Invite all my sad captains .
Let's drink through midnight .
It's my birthday .
I had planned to celebrate it quietly , but since my lord is once more himself , I will be Cleopatra again .
We'll win yet .
Do so .
I'll speak to them , and then tonight I'll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .
Now he'll work himself up to a fury .
When courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
I'll look for some way to leave his service .
He calls me "boy" and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of Egypt .
Let the old ruffian discover that I have many other ways to die , and in the meantime , we'll laugh at his challenge .
Don't give him time to catch his breath .
Anger does not protect the angry well .
Tell our top commanders that I want tomorrow's battle to be the last we fight .
Our army has recently acquired many of Mark Antony's former soldiers , enough to capture him .
See that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
We have enough supplies for it , and they've earned it .
Poor Antony !
What would you like , sir ?
I have to leave right away .
That will kill our lovers .
We know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
If we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
I must be gone .
If it's that important , then let the women die .
It would be a pity to throw them away for nothing , but if it's a matter of choosing between them and a great cause , then they're worthless .
If Cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she'll die immediately .
I've seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
I think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
She's more cunning than anyone can imagine .
Her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
He won't fight with me , Domitius ?
No .
Why won't he ?
He thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours , it would be like pitting twenty men against one .
Tomorrow , soldier , I'll fight by sea and land .
By the end I will either live , or else I'll restore my honor by shedding my blood .
Will you fight well ?
When I strike , I'll cry , "All or nothing ! " Well put .
Come on .
Call out my household servants .
Tonight let's have plenty to eat .
You have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
The gods forbid !
Well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
Keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants , obeying my commands .
Look , they're crying .
Ha , ha , ha !
May the evil one take me if I meant it like that !
Those tears will bring blessings to you .
You interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
You should know , my friends , that I have good hopes for tomorrow , and that I will lead you as if I expect victory rather than an honorable death .
Good night , brother .
Tomorrow is the day .
Have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city ?
No .
What was it ?
It was probably just a rumor .
Good night .
Well sir , good night .
Soldiers , watch carefully .
You too .
This is our station .
And if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
It's an outstanding army and highly motivated .
Quiet !
What's that sound ?
Listen !
There's music coming out of thin air .
From under the earth .
It's a lucky sign , isn't it ?
No .
Quiet , I say .
What does this mean ?
Hello there , good sirs .
Yes .
Isn't it strange ?
Do you hear that , men ?
Do you ?
Let's follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops .
Good idea .
It's very strange .
Get a little sleep .
Come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you're carrying .
If luck deserts us today , it's because we defy it .
Come on .
No , I'll help too .
What's this part for ?
Ah , leave it alone .
You armor my heart .
No !
No !
Really , I'll help .
It must go like this .
We've got it now. , Do you see this , my good fellow ?
Go and put on your own armor .
In a minute , sir .
Didn't I buckle this well ?
Excellently , excellently .
Hurry. , Oh , love , if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert I am at my craft .
Good morning to you .
Welcome .
You look like a person who knows the business of war .
When we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
Even though it's early , there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .
The weather is fair .
Good morning , General .
Good morning , General .
That was a fine fanfare , boys .
Like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
Farewell , lady .
Whatever happens to me , this is a soldier's kiss .
I'll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
Lead the way .
He goes forth to war bravely .
May the gods bless Antony today !
I wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
If you had , the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .
Who deserted this morning ?
You don't know ?
Someone who was always near you .
Sir , he's with Caesar .
Sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
He's gone ?
It's certain .
Eros , send his treasure to him .
Do it now .
Don't keep anything back , I insist .
Write to him from me , I'll sign it , sending greetings and gentle good-byes .
Say that I hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
Oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
Hurry .
Fulvia is dead .
Pardon me ?
Fulvia is dead .
Fulvia ?
Dead .
Then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
If Fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
But in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
The only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
I must go and continue the business Fulvia started .
The business you began here needs you as well , especially the business with Cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
Enough of this frivolous talk .
Give our officers notice of our intentions .
I'll tell the Queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
Fulvia's death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons I am eager to go ; friends in Rome have also sent many letters advising my return .
The empire may be in danger if he's not restrained before he reaches his full potential .
There are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
Agrippa , go start the battle .
We want Antony taken alive .
Make sure everyone knows that .
I will , Caesar .
An era of universal peace is about to start .
That way Antony will feel like he's fighting his own men .
Caesar hanged him for this service .
Canidius and the others that left Antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
I've done a bad thing , for which I will blame myself so much that I'll never be happy again .
Enobarbus , Antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
The messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
It's yours .
Don't joke about this , Enobarbus .
I'm telling you the truth .
You'd better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
I'd do it myself , but I can't leave my post .
Your Emperor is still a king among gods .
I am the worst person alive , and I know it the best .
Oh , Antony , you extravagantly generous man , how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !
My heart feels like it's about to explode .
If grief doesn't kill me , I'll find a quicker way to kill myself , even though I think grief will do the job just as well .
I , fight against you , Antony ?
No , I'll go find some ditch to die in .
The foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
Retreat !
We've advanced too far .
Caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
Oh , my brave Emperor , this is what I call a fight !
If we'd fought like this before , we'd have driven them home with bandaged heads .
You're bleeding a lot .
I had a scar here that looked like a "T" ; now it's an "H." They're retreating .
We'll chase 'em into their latrines .
I still have room for six more wounds .
They're retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
Let's slash their backs and grab 'em like we do rabbits , from behind .
It's fair game to mark a coward .
I'll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
Come on .
I'll limp after you .
We've driven him all the way back to his camp .
One of you run to the Queen with the news .
Before sunrise tomorrow , we'll kill anyone who escaped today .
You are all Lord of lords !
Have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
My songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
What do you think , girl !
Look at this man .
Today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
He deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
If we aren't relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
Oh , listen to me , night , Who is this ?
Stay hidden and listen .
Be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
That's Enobarbus ?
Quiet !
Keep listening .
My heart , which dried out with grief , will surely break apart into a powder , and that will be the end of my disgusting mind .
Oh , Antony !
Let's speak to him .
Let's listen to him .
Good idea .
But he's sleeping .
No one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .
Let's go to him .
Wake up , sir , wake up .
Speak to us .
Do you hear us , sir ?
The hand of death has taken him .
Let's carry him to the barracks .
He's an important person .
Our hour is up .
Come on , then .
He may recover yet .
I will .
They've switched their operation to the sea today .
We didn't please them on land .
We're ready for both , my lord .
I wish they'd fight in fire or in the air .
But here's the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
Let's take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
They still haven't joined the battle .
I'll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
I'll let you know right away how it's going .
Swallows have built nests in Cleopatra's sails .
All is lost !
This treacherous Egyptian has betrayed me .
Three-time traitor and whore !
Tell the army to flee .
Order them to escape .
Go !
Oh , sun , I will never see another one of your sunrises .
Luck and Antony separate here and now .
Here we'll shake hands good-bye .
Is it all come to this ?
I've been stripped of everything , betrayed .
Oh , that devious Egyptian spirit !
Ah , you sorceress !
Be gone !
Why is my lord enraged against his love ?
Get out of my sight , or I'll give you what you deserve and spoil Caesar's victory .
Let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
Follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
Then let Octavia dig up your face with her nails .
She'll die for it. , Eros , ho !
Help me , ladies !
Go to your tomb !
Lock yourself in and send him word that you're dead .
When a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
Say the last word I spoke was "Antony , " and please word it pathetically .
Go , Mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
Eros , can you still see me ?
Yes , noble lord .
You've seen these illusions .
Yes , my lord .
What looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind , made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water .
That's true , my lord .
Eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
Here and now I seem like Antony , but I can't keep myself in this form , my boy .
No , don't cry , kind Eros .
Oh , your contemptible lady !
She has disarmed me .
Get out , insolent eunuch !
Silence !
She has betrayed me and shall die .
A person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
What you wanted is yours .
Most noble Antony ! " Then , as she was speaking your name , a strangled groan split her words .
Antony" was divided between her heart and lips .
She gave up her life with your name still within her .
Is she dead , then ?
Dead .
Remove your armor , Eros .
Off !
Take off my armor .
Oh , chest , obey me !
Heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
Faster , Eros , faster .
I won't be a soldier anymore .
Battered armor , be off .
You were worn with honor .
I will catch up with you , Cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
Since the light of my life has gone out , I'll stop here .
Now any effort ruins what it attempts .
Yes , even power gets in its own way .
End it , then , and everything is over. , Eros ! , I'm coming , my Queen ! , Eros ! , Wait for me .
In the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we'll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .
Eros !
What can I do for my lord ?
Since Cleopatra died , I have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
Do it .
This is that time .
You won't be striking me down , but defeating Caesar .
Call up your courage .
The gods forbid !
Can I do what all the Parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
Eros , would you like to look through a window in Rome and watch your master marching in Caesar's victory parade , his arms crossed and tied , his head bowed in submission , his face red from shame , while the chariot of triumphant Caesar precedes him , putting the final stamp to his humiliation ?
I would not .
Draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
Oh , sir , pardon me !
When I freed you from slavery , didn't you swear to do this when I asked you ?
Do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
Take out your sword and come on .
Then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
Look !
Where is he ?
I haven't seen him recently .
What should I do that I'm not doing ?
Always give him his way .
Never contradict him .
Don't push him too far .
I wish you'd be patient .
We come to hate that which controls us .
But here comes Antony .
I am sick and sullen .
I'm sorry to have to say this , Help me away from here , dear Charmian !
I shall faint .
I have drawn my sword .
My dear master , my captain , my sovereign , let me say before I strike this fatal blow : farewell .
You've said it , friend , and farewell to you .
Good-bye , great commander .
Should I do it now ?
Now , Eros .
Well , then , there !
With this I avoid the grief of Antony's death .
My Queen and Eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
I learned to do this from you .
What !
I'm not dead ?
Oh , kill me !
What's the trouble ?
I've botched the job , friends .
Oh , finish what I've begun .
Our guiding light is out .
And time itself is ended .
Sadness and despair !
Whoever's a real friend should strike me dead .
Not me .
Me neither .
None of us .
Your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
I only need to show your sword to Caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor .
Where's Antony ?
There , Diomedes , there .
Is he still alive ?
Why don't you answer me , man ?
Is that you , Diomedes ?
Draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
Most powerful lord , my mistress Cleopatra sent me to you .
When did she send you ?
Just now , my lord .
Where is she ?
Locked in her tomb .
She had a premonition of what has actually happened .
Afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
Too late , good Diomedes .
Call my guard , please .
Hey out there !
Carry me , good friends , to where Cleopatra is .
It's the last command I shall ever give you .
We're very sorry , sir , that you may not live to wear us out with your commands .
It's a very sad day .
No , my friends , don't please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
If we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
Pick me up .
I have often led you , now you must carry me , my good friends , and take my thanks for everything .
Oh , Charmian , I will never leave this tomb !
Be calm , dear lady .
No , I won't .
Strange and terrible events are all welcome , but I despise comforts .
The size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
What's the news !
Is he dead ?
He is close to death , but not dead yet .
Oh , Antony , Antony , Antony !
Help , Charmian , help , Iras , help !
Be calm !
It was not Caesar's bravery that conquered Antony but Antony's that has triumphed over himself .
That's the way it should be , only Antony should conquer Antony .
No , our general's infatuation is out of control .
His eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
His heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he's lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an Egyptian whore .
Look at them .
Take a good look , and you'll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore's jester .
Look and see .
If what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
It would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
I want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
Then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
I have news from Rome , my good lord .
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
I just beg death to wait awhile , until I place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .
I don't dare come down , forgive me , my lord , I don't dare , for fear of capture .
I will never be exhibited as lucky Caesar's prize .
If knives , poison , or snakes have edge , effect , or venom , I am safe from that fate .
Your wife Octavia , with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions , won't get any praise from patronizing me .
Help us , good friends .
Oh , quick , before I'm gone .
Such exercise !
My lord is so heavy !
If I had the goddess Juno's power , I would make the strong-winged messenger , Mercury , pick you up and seat you beside Jove .
And welcome , welcome !
Die where you have lived , in my arms .
If my lips had the power to give life , I would wear them out like this .
What a sad sight !
I am dying , Cleopatra , dying .
Give me some wine and let me say a few words .
I'll trust my determination and my hands , but none of Caesar's men .
Now I feel my soul leaving .
I can't speak any more .
Most noble man , will you die ?
Don't you care about me ?
Shall I stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
My lord !
Oh , the glory of war has faded .
The flags have fallen .
Young boys and girls are equal to men .
There is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
Our Queen is dead too .
Lady !
Madam !
Oh , madam , madam , madam !
Royal Egypt , Empress !
Quiet , quiet , Iras .
Now I am no more than a woman , ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores .
Now all is for nothing .
How are you , my ladies ?
Cheer up !
How are you , Charmian ?
My gallant girls !
Good noble ladies , be brave .
We'll bury him , and then we'll commit acts as brave and fine as any Romans , and make death proud to take us .
Come on , you can go .
The container of that great soul is now cold .
Ah , ladies , ladies !
Let's go .
We have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
Tell him to surrender .
His position is hopeless .
Right away , Caesar .
What are you doing with a sword ?
Who do you think you are coming in here armed ?
My name is Decretus .
I served Mark Antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
While he was alive , I lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
If not , you can kill me .
What are you saying ?
Caesar , I'm telling you that Antony is dead .
When such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
The fractured world , in its confusion , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions' dens .
This isn't the death of one man .
It's the death of half the world .
Now , my dearest Queen , Please , stand farther away from me .
What's the matter ?
I can see in your eyes there's been some good news .
What , does your wife say you can come home ?
I wish she'd never let you come .
Don't let her say I kept you .
I have no power over you .
You belong to her .
The gods know , Oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as I have been .
I knew from the first it would be this way .
Cleopatra , How could I have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves , you , who were unfaithful to Fulvia ?
It was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
When you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
You didn't want to go then !
You saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
My features are still that beautiful , or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
This is his sword .
I pulled it from his wound .
Look , his noble blood is still on it .
Listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
His faults were equally matched by his virtues .
But gods , you give us faults so we'll be human .
Caesar is upset .
Either I had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
Let me tell you , friends ,
I'll tell you at a better time .
This man looks like his business is urgent .
Let's hear what he has to say .
Tell her to put her mind at rest .
She'll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her .
May the gods bless you .
Come here , Proculeius .
Tell her we mean her no disrespect .
Go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
I will , Caesar .
Gallus , you go with him .
Where's Dolabella ?
Dolabella !
I remember he's already occupied .
He'll be done in time .
Come and see the proof .
It's pathetic to be Caesar .
He can't be Fortune ; he's only Fortune's errand boy .
Caesar greets the Queen of Egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
What's your name ?
My name is Proculeius .
But I don't worry about being deceived because I don't need to trust .
If your master wants a queen to beg from him , you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom .
If he will grant me conquered Egypt , so that I may give it to my son , I will kneel to him with thanks .
Be content .
You're in the charge of an honorable man .
Don't be afraid .
If I can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly , he'll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you .
Please tell him I have surrendered to his fortune .
I'm learning every hour how to be subservient .
I'll tell him all of this , dear lady .
Be at ease .
Your majesty !
Oh , Cleopatra !
Stop , brave lady , stop !
We have not betrayed you .
What , am I being denied death , as well ?
Don't insult my master's generosity by killing yourself .
Your death would prevent that .
Where are you , Death ?
Come here .
Come , and you can have a queen .
Oh , control yourself , lady !
Let Caesar do whatever he wants .
You'd better understand that I won't wait till I'm chained up in your master's court , and I won't let myself be scolded even once by dull Octavia .
Shall I let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of Rome ?
I'd rather die in a ditch in Egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
I'd rather lie in the Nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me , making me disgusting .
I'd rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !
You'll see that Caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
Proculeius , Caesar has heard about what you've done here and has sent for you .
I'll take the Queen into my custody .
So be it , Dolabella .
Be kind to her .
Have you heard of me , most noble Empress ?
I don't remember .
You must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
Isn't that your habit ?
I don't know what you mean , madam .
I dreamed about an emperor called Antony .
Oh , I wish I could sleep again , so I could have another dream like that !
When he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
There was no end to his generosity .
Kings and noblemen served him .
Kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
Cleopatra , Do you think there ever was , or could there ever be , a man such as the one I dreamed about ?
No , gentle madam .
The gods can hear you lying !
Antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
Listen to me , madam .
You are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
I hope I never achieve success if I don't feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
Thank you , sir .
Do you know what Caesar intends to do with me ?
I'm reluctant to tell you what I wish you knew .
You need not kneel to me .
Please rise , Queen .
The gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
Don't think I blame you .
I'll leave you now .
You may do whatever you want in the world .
It's yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
Here , my good lord .
What do you mean , lady ?
I wish I were as big and strong as you .
Listen to me , Queen .
There is an emergency I must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
My Italy is full of civil war .
Sextus Pompeius is sailing toward the port of Rome .
But my personal motivation , and that which should move you most to sanction my departure , is that Fulvia is dead .
Is it possible Fulvia is dead ?
She's dead , my Queen .
You shall advise me in everything having to do with Cleopatra .
This is the inventory of the money , silverware , dishes , and jewels that are still in my possession .
Not even trivial things were left out .
Where's Seleucus ?
Here , madam .
This is my treasurer .
My lord , he will swear on his life that I haven't kept a thing. , Tell the truth , Seleucus .
Madam , I'd rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it .
What did I keep for myself ?
Enough to buy everything you have declared .
No , don't be ashamed , Cleopatra .
Look around you , Caesar .
Oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
Seleucus' ingratitude makes me wild .
I'll give you a good reason to cringe , I promise you .
I'll scratch out your eyes , even if they could fly .
Oh , that was unbelievably low !
Cleopatra , our conquest won't include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
It's all still yours .
Do whatever you like with it .
So cheer up .
No , dear Queen .
Eat and sleep .
I have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
And so , good-bye .
My master and my lord !
Not true .
Good-bye .
But listen , Charmian .
It's time to end it , good lady .
I will , madam .
Where's the Queen ?
Look , sir .
Dolabella .
Make the best use of this information you can .
I have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
Dolabella , I will always be in debt to you .
And I your servant .
Good-bye , good Queen .
I must go attend Caesar .
Farewell , and thanks .
Now , Iras , what do you think ?
You will be exhibited in Rome along with me , like Egyptian puppets .
Crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
The gods forbid !
No , it's certain , Iras .
Insolent Oh , the good gods !
No , that's the truth .
I'll never see it .
I know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; I'll scratch them out .
Why , that's just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
Now , Charmian !
Women , dress me like a queen .
Go get my best clothes .
What's that noise ?
There's a farmer here who won't leave without seeing your Highness .
He has brought you figs .
Let him come in .
What a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
He brings me freedom .
There's nothing of the weak woman left in me .
Now from head to foot I'm as firm as marble .
Now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
This is the man .
Leave us .
Do you have in there the pretty snake of the Nile that kills without pain ?
I certainly do have him , but I wouldn't advise you to touch him .
People who die of it seldom or never recover .
Do you remember anyone who died of it ?
Many people , men and women alike .
Indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake's power .
But if you believe everything they say , you won't be saved by half of what they do .
But this is a sure thing : the snake's an odd snake .
I hope you are pleased with the snake .
Farewell .
You must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
Yes , yes .
Farewell .
There isn't any kindness in the snake .
Good .
Will it eat me ?
Don't think I'm so dumb that I don't know that the devil himself won't eat a woman .
Well , you can go now .
Farewell .
Give me my robe .
Put on my crown .
I long to be immortal .
Quickly , quickly , good Iras , quickly .
I think I hear Antony call me .
I see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
I hear him mock Caesar's luck , which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .
Now let my courage prove my title as wife .
So , are you done ?
Come then , kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips .
Good-bye , kind Charmian .
Iras , I won't see you again for a long time .
Do I have the asp's poison on my lips ?
Did you fall ?
If you can leave your body so easily , then the touch of death is like a lover's pinch , which hurts but is desired .
Do you lie still ?
If you leave like that , you tell the world that it's not worthy of a good-bye .
Clouds , dissolve into rain , so that I could say the gods themselves are weeping !
Separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
Poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
Oh , if you could speak , I might hear you call Caesar an ass who's been outsmarted !
Oh , eastern star !
Quiet , quiet !
Don't you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
The poison is as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , Oh , Antony ! , No , I'll take you too .
Why should I stay , In this vile world ?
So , good-bye .
Now , Death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
Close , soft eyes .
The sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
Your crown is crooked .
I'll straighten it , then play , Where's the Queen ?
Speak softly .
Don't wake her .
Caesar has sent , Too slow a messenger .
Oh , come quickly !
I almost feel you .
There's Dolabella , who was sent from Caesar .
Call him .
What kind of work is this , Charmian ?
Is this well done ?
It is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
Ah , soldier !
What's going on in here ?
They're all dead .
Caesar , you thought this would happen .
You're coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
Oh , unfaithful lover !
Stop arguing and listen to my plans .
Whether I go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
I swear by the sun that when I leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
Cut my corset laces , Charmian , so I can breathe .
Hurry !
Just as Antony loves .
Control yourself , my precious Queen , and concede that my love is true .
That's what Fulvia told me .
I beg you , turn away and cry for her .
Then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
Oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
What you were afraid of has happened .
How did they die ?
I don't see any blood .
Who was with them last ?
A simple country farmer who brought her figs .
This was the basket .
They were poisoned , then .
Oh , Caesar , this Charmian lived until a moment ago .
She stood and spoke .
I found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
She stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
Oh , noble weakness !
Here on her breast there's a little bloody mark .
There's a similar mark on her arm .
This is an asp's trail , and these fig leaves have slime on them , just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the Nile .
Pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
She shall be buried next to her Antony .
No other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
Our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for Rome .
Come , Dolabella .
You'll make me angry .
No more of this .
I know you can do better than that , but it'll do for now .
I swear by my sword , Swear by your shield , too !
I'll leave you , lady .
Polite sir , let me say one thing .
Sir , you and I must part company , no , that's not it .
It's difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
Even the traits that become me most kill me when you don't approve of them .
Your honor is the reason you are leaving .
May the gods be with you .
May your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
Let's go .
Come with me .
Our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though I leave here , I stay with you .
You're too forgiving .
Even if we said that this behavior suits him , though only a man with a perfect character could avoid being disgraced by such antics , there's no excuse for the extra work we've had to take on while he's been off amusing himself .
If he's been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he'll be punished with venereal diseases , and that's his business .
Here's more news .
Pompey has a strong navy .
I should have known it .
It's been this way ever since the first government was organized .
Caesar , I have news about Menecrates and Menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
They've made many raids upon Italy , and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
Antony , it's time to stop your wild hedonism .
And even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand .
You drank horses' urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
It's too bad .
Let's hope his sense of shame will send him back to Rome quickly .
It's time that we brought our armies into the field .
Pompey is making the most of our absence .
Tomorrow , Caesar , I'll be able to tell you what land and sea forces I can raise for this war .
I'll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
Good-bye .
Good-bye , my lord .
Charmian !
Madam ?
So I can sleep away the time while my Antony is gone .
You think about him too much .
That's treason !
I hope not , Madam .
What can I do for your highness ?
I don't want to hear you sing .
I'm not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
It's a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs .
Do you have desires ?
Yes , dear madam .
Indeed ?
Well , not in deed , madam , since I can't do anything unchaste .
Is he standing or sitting ?
Or is he walking ?
Or is he on his horse ?
Oh , how fortunate that horse is to have Antony on him .
He's speaking now , or perhaps he's whispering , "Where's my serpent of the Nile ? " For that's his pet name for me .
I'm killing myself with this provocative speculation.. .
Are you thinking about me ?
No , listen to it , Antony .
Perhaps What , my love ?
Maybe ?
No , most likely .
You can't stay here any longer .
Call in the messengers and we'll find out .
As surely as I am the queen of Egypt , Antony , you're blushing , which means you're Caesar's servant .
Call the messengers !
Queen of Egypt , greetings !
You are nothing like Mark Antony !
But since you come from him , you're saturated with his healing spirit .
How does it go with my magnificent Mark Antony ?
The last thing he did before sending me off , dear Queen , was to kiss , the last of many such kisses , this Indian pearl for you .
My ear must pull it out .
Good friend , " he said , "say that the faithful Roman sends an oyster's treasure to the great Queen of Egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire .
Tell her that the entire East shall call her Queen." Then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything I might have said in reply .
Was he sad or happy ?
He was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
Just notice .
He wasn't sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
He was somewhere in the middle , between them.. .
Oh , heavenly mixture !
Whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else.. .
Yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
Why did you send so many ?
Whoever is born on a day I forget to send a message to Antony will die a beggar .
Bring ink and paper , Charmian .
Welcome , my good Alexas .
Charmian , did I ever love Caesar as much as this ?
Oh , that splendid Caesar !
May you choke on any other sentiments like that !
Say , "That splendid Antony." The courageous Caesar !
By Isis , I'll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare Caesar with Antony , my best man among men .
Pardon me , but I'm just repeating what you yourself have said .
That was when I was young and inexperienced and didn't know what passion was .
In that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
I'll do well .
The people are on my side , and I'm in charge of the sea .
My forces are growing , and everything I know tells me it's all coming together .
Mark Antony is at dinner in Egypt and won't be going outside to make war .
Caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
Lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn't love them , and they don't love him .
Caesar and Lepidus are organizing their military operation .
They have a massive army .
Where did you hear this ?
It's not true .
From Silvius , sir .
He's dreaming .
I know they're in Rome together , hoping for Antony to return .
Lecherous Cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
Join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let Antony's lust combine with both .
Keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
This news is absolutely true : Mark Antony is expected to arrive in Rome at any hour now .
In the time since he left Egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
His military ability is double that of the other two .
We must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable Antony's attention away from that Egyptian widow .
I don't expect Caesar and Antony will have a very friendly reunion .
Menas , I don't understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
It will be as the gods see fit .
In any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
Let's go , Menas .
Good Enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
I will advise him to speak as he usually does .
By Jupiter , if I were Antony , I wouldn't shave my beard today .
This is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
But major issues must come before minor ones .
Not if the minor ones come up first .
Here comes the noble Antony .
And there comes Caesar .
You're right .
If we were in front of our armies , about to fight , I would do this .
Welcome to Rome .
Thank you .
Have a seat .
After you .
No , after you .
I should be ridiculed if I were offended so easily , and laughed at even more for speaking of you disrespectfully , when I had no reason to speak of you at all .
Caesar , what did my stay in Egypt have to do with you ?
No more than my staying here in Rome might mean to you in Egypt .
But if you conspired against my position while you were there , I might be interested in the reason for your stay in Egypt .
How do you mean , "conspired" ?
You can judge for yourself what I mean .
Your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
They said they were acting for you .
You're mistaken .
My brother didn't use my name to justify his rebellion .
He rejected my authority as much as yours .
I've already sent the proof in my letters .
If you want to pick a fight , you'll have to find a more substantial excuse .
You defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you're just making up feeble excuses .
Not true , not true .
You know I would never approve a war against my own cause .
As for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
It's easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
But you can't blame me for her offenses .
I sent you a letter while you were carousing in Alexandria .
I was not myself , as a result of the wine .
The next day I explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
Let's not fight over this fellow .
Meet with the ambassadors .
Tonight we'll wander through the streets and observe the people .
You will never be able to say the same about me .
Go on , Caesar .
What part of the agreement did I break ?
You agreed to send me troops and weapons when I needed them .
You refused me both .
I overlooked your request , but I did not deny it .
Your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .
Spoken like a gentleman .
If it's okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
Well put , Maecenas .
Or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with Pompey is finished .
You can argue as much as you like when there's nothing else to do .
You are only a soldier .
Don't speak any further .
As you please .
May I speak , Caesar .
What is it , Agrippa ?
You have a beautiful half-sister , Octavia .
Great Mark Antony is a widower now .
You'd better not make that suggestion , Agrippa .
If Cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
It's true I'm not married , Caesar .
Let me hear what Agrippa has to say .
With this marriage , all the petty jealousies that now seem huge , and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves , would disappear .
Since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
What do you say , Caesar ?
He has both my power and my influence over Octavia .
I wouldn't dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
Here's my hand .
I give you a sister whom I love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
She will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
I'm happy to say "amen" to that !
I didn't think I would ever fight Pompey .
There isn't much time .
Either we go after Pompey or he'll come after us .
Where is he now ?
Near How large is his land army ?
Large and increasing .
But his navy rules the sea .
That's what I hear .
Come with us , Lepidus .
Noble Antony , even illness couldn't keep me away .
Good Enobarbus !
We can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
And I see you survived your time in Egypt .
We heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast , for only twelve people !
Is that true ?
That was nothing .
There were many even more memorable feasts .
She's a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
I'll tell you .
The sails were dyed purple , and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love .
The oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
Pretty , Cupid-like boys stood on either side of her , smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans , which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them , undoing what they did .
How excellent for Antony !
When she landed at the port , Antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
She replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
Royal seductress !
Now Antony has to leave her completely .
Age won't wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
Even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
Let's go .
Good Enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you're here .
I humbly thank you .
And I will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
Good night .
Tell me why , if you can .
But you had better get back to Egypt again .
Tell me who shall have the better luck , Caesar or me ?
Caesar .
So you'd better not stay with him , Antony .
Your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when Caesar's not around .
But when you are with him , your angel is weakened and easily frightened .
That's why there must be space between you .
Have a good night !
Don't speak of this again .
To none but you , only to you .
With his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
Your light dulls when he is near .
Leave now .
Tell Ventidius I want to speak with him .
Come here , Ventidius .
You must go to Parthia .
Your authorization is ready .
Come with me and I'll get it for you .
Don't spend any more time here .
Go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
Sir , we'll follow as soon as Mark Antony kisses Octavia good-bye .
Good-bye then , until the time I see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
You're taking a shorter route .
My plans take me a roundabout way .
You'll get there two days before me .
Good luck , sir .
Farewell .
Play me some music .
Music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
Musicians , come in !
Never mind .
Let's play billiards .
Play with me , Charmian .
My arm is sore .
I'll do my best , madam .
I don't want to play now .
Give me my fishing rod .
We'll go to the river .
With my music playing in the background , I'll lure fish .
Cram your good news into my ears .
Madam , madam , Antony's dead !
If you say that , you bastard , you'll kill your Queen .
Kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
Let me say first , madam , that he is well .
Well then , here's more money for you .
But you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
If that's what you mean , I'll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words .
Good madam , let me speak .
All right , I will .
But you don't look as if you bring good news .
If you really are Sir Rowland's son , as you've just whispered to me , and I can absolutely see the likeness in your face , you are truly welcome here .
I am the duke who loved your father .
Come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story. , Good old man , you are as welcome here as your master is .
Give him your arm .
Give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
You haven't seen him since ?
Sir , sir , that can't be true .
If I weren't a merciful man , I'd forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place .
But do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
Bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
I'm seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt .
I wish your Highness knew my true feelings in this matter : I have never in my life loved my brother .
That makes you an even bigger villain. , Well , throw him out , and have my officers seize his house and lands .
Do this immediately , and send him packing .
Hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
And you , And how are you liking the shepherd's life , Master Touchstone ?
Well , in and of itself , it is a good life , but given that it's a shepherd's life , it's worthless .
In the fact that it's solitary , I enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it's private , it's terrible .
Now , I'm very pleased with it being outdoors , but in its not being at the court , it is boring .
Are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
You're a natural-born philosopher !
Were you ever at court , shepherd ?
Honestly , no .
Then you are damned .
I hope not .
Explain .
Well , if you were never at court , you were never exposed to good manners ; if you never witnessed good manners , your manners must be wicked ; wickedness is a sin , and committing sins leads to damnation .
You are in a perilous state , shepherd .
Not at all , Touchstone .
The good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court .
You told me that you don't salute at the court but kiss hands .
Now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
Give a quick example .
Come , explain .
Why , because we're always handling our ewes , and their fleece , as you know , is greasy .
What , don't courtiers ' hands sweat ?
And isn't a sheep's grease as wholesome as a man's sweat ?
That's a poor example .
A better example , come on .
Besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
Then your lips will feel them more quickly .
Come on .
You worthless man !
You are about as much of a thinker as worm's meat is a nice steak .
Learn from the wise , and comprehend : the courtier's perfume is made from cat discharge , much more disgusting than tar .
Fix your example , shepherd .
Your wit is too courtly for me .
I'll rest now .
Good morning , sir .
Can you tell me whether Rosalind , Duke Senior's daughter , has also been banished ?
Where will the old duke live ?
You're going to rest while you're still damned ?
God help you , foolish man .
Pray God does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
That's another sin arising from your ignorance : you bring ewes and rams together and make your living by their copulation .
Here comes young Mr. Ganymede , my new mistress's brother .
There is no jewel like Rosalind .
Her worth is carried on the wind And it blows throughout the world , carrying the name of Rosalind .
All the most beautiful paintings Are black when compared to Rosalind .
Don't think of any beauty But the beauty of Rosalind .
I could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
That awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
Oh , stop , fool .
Let me try : If there's a buck who needs a doe Tell him Rosalind will do .
A cat in heat will look for a mate , And Rosalind certainly will too .
Winter garments need to be filled with something , And so does skinny Rosalind .
After you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind So throw ripe Rosalind on the harvest cart .
The sweetest nut has the sourest rind And Rosalind is that kind of nut .
The man who finds the sweetest rose Will be pricked by it , and by Rosalind .
This is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
Why bother with them ?
Quiet , you stupid fool .
I found them on a tree .
Well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
All right , you've had your say , but we'll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely .
Quiet !
But on the prettiest branches Or at the end of every sentence I'll write "Rosalinda , " Teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit Is contained in this one woman .
Heaven commanded Nature To fill her one body With all the graces that women contain .
Nature took Helen's Cleopatra's majesty , The best of Atalanta , And unhappy Lucretia's modesty .
So , by heaven's decree , Rosalind Was composed Of different faces , eyes , and hearts , so that she might have the most prized touches of all .
Heaven wanted Rosalind to have these gifts And me to live and die as her slave .
Were you listening to these verses ?
Oh yes , I heard them all , and more , too .
Some of those lines had more feet than the That's not a problem : the feet can bear Sure , but these feet were
But did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees ?
Was it a man ?
And he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
Are you blushing ?
Please , who ?
It's difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
No , who are you talking about ?
Is it possible ?
No , I'm begging you now , tell me who it is .
Oh , this is wonderful , wonderful , just wonderful wonderful !
Good grief , do you think that just because I'm dressed like a man , I have a man's patience ?
Every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to South Seas .
I'm begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
I wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle : either too much at once or none at all .
I'm begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so I can drink the news .
So you want to put a man in your belly .
Did God make him ?
I mean , what sort of man is he ?
Is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
No , he has only a little beard .
Well , eventually God will send him some more hair , if he thanks Him .
I'll wait till his beard grows in , if you'll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on .
It's Orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
Damn you for mocking me .
Really , cousin , it's him .
Orlando ?
Orlando .
What did he do when you saw him ?
What did he say ?
How did he look ?
Where did he go ?
What brings him here ?
Did he ask about me ?
Where is he staying ?
How did he say good-bye ?
And when will you see him again ?
Answer me in a word .
You'd better get me But does he know that I'm here in the forest and dressed in men's clothing ?
Does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
But taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
I found Orlando under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
That tree could be called God's tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
Let me talk , good lady .
Go on .
He lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
Though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
Cry , "whoa ! " to your tongue , please .
It's leaping about like a frisky horse .
He was dressed like a hunter .
Oh , that's ominous !
He has come to kill my heart .
I'd like to sing my song solo .
You're making me go off-key .
Don't you know that I'm a woman ?
Whatever I think , I have to say .
Sweetheart , go on .
Quiet !
Isn't that him heading this way ?
That's him .
Thanks for your company but , really , I would have preferred being alone .
Me too , but still , for the sake of good manners , I'll say thanks for your company .
Goodbye .
Let's meet as little as we can .
I also hope that we can be better strangers .
Please don't ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
Please don't ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
Your love's name is Rosalind ?
Yes , that's it .
I don't like her name .
How tall is she ?
Just as tall as my heart .
You're sure full of smooth answers .
Your worst fault is being in love .
Well , it's a fault I wouldn't trade for your best virtue .
I'm tired of you .
There I'll see only myself .
Which is either a fool or a nothing .
I'm not going to waste any more time with you .
Goodbye , good Mr. Love .
I'm glad to see you go .
Adieu , good Mr. Depression .
Very well .
What do you want ?
You should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
There's no clock here in the forest .
Then there must be no lovers in the forest , either , because they're as good as a clock , marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .
Indeed I do , sir , and I've come to let you in on a certain problem .
I've been informed by certain sources I can't disclose that your younger brother Orlando plans to fight me in disguise .
Tomorrow , sir , I'm fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed .
Your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , I'd hate to crush him , though I'd have to , if he challenged me .
I'm telling you all this out of affection for you , so you can either keep him from carrying out his plans or prepare to accept his disgrace , which will be his own fault , not mine .
Charles , I thank you for your loyalty to me , and you'll see that I'll reward you .
I'd heard about my brother's plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he's determined .
I tell you , Charles , he's the stubbornest young fellow in France : overly ambitious , jealous of other people's good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother .
So use your discretion .
I'd be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
But if I really laid him bare , I'd have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
Why didn't you say "the swift steps" of time instead of the "lazy foot" ?
Wouldn't that have been just as appropriate ?
No , not at all , sir .
Time travels at different speeds for different people .
I can tell you who time strolls for , who it trots for , who it gallops for , and who it stops cold for .
Okay , who does it trot for ?
Who does time amble for ?
Time ambles for both men .
Who does it gallop for ?
Who does it stand still for ?
For lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
Where do you live , pretty young man ?
Were you born here ?
Just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
Your speech is more refined than I would expect in such a remote place as this .
Many people have told me so .
Actually , an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak , and he was brought up in the city .
Thank God I'm not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
What were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
There were no primary ones .
Please , tell me some of them .
No , I won't give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
There's a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving "Rosalind" on their barks .
Well , I'm the man you're speaking of .
Please , tell me your cure .
But you don't have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
He taught me how to recognize a man in love , and you're not a prisoner of love , I'm sure .
What did he say the symptoms were ?
A thin face , which you don't have ; a sleepless , sunken eye , which you don't have ; an irritable temper , which you don't have ; a neglected beard , which you don't have , but that might not be so telling , since you don't have much beard anyway .
Your stockings should be falling down around your ankles , your hat flying off your head , your sleeves unbuttoned , your shoes untied , and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery .
But you're no such man .
You're so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
Young boy , I wish I could make you believe that I'm in love .
Make me believe it ?
But really , are you the one who's been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of Rosalind ?
I swear to you by Rosalind's own pretty hand that I am that unfortunate man .
Are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much I love her .
The only reason they don't get punished and cured is that the disease is so commonplace that the nuthouse nurses are usually suffering from it , too .
But I promise it can be cured with some guidance .
Have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
Yes , one , and this is how I did it .
I don't want to be cured , boy .
I could cure you , if you just called me Rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .
By my faith in love , I will , then .
Tell me where you live .
Come with me , I'll show you , and along the way , you can tell me where you live .
Will you come ?
Wholeheartedly , good young man .
No , you have to call me Rosalind. , Sister , you're coming ?
Come on , sweet Audrey .
I'll get your goats , Audrey .
Do my simple features please you ?
Your features , God help us !
What features ?
Really , Audrey , I wish you were more poetical .
I don't know what "poetical" means .
Is it "chaste in word and action" ?
Does it mean being truthful ?
Not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
But you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
I do , in fact .
Right now you swear to me that you are a virgin ; if you were a poet , I might have some hope you were lying .
What , you don't want me to be chaste ?
Not really , unless you were ugly .
Well , I'm not beautiful , so I hope that I can at least be chaste .
I'm not a slut , I keep myself clean , but I thank God I am ugly .
Well , praise the Lord you're ugly .
Well , God bless this marriage !
Amen .
Well , that's what the wife brings to the marriage .
Horns ?
Well , there they are .
Only for poor men ?
No , no .
The nobleman's are as huge as the underfed villager's .
Is the single man lucky , then ?
No .
Just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village , a married man's horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor's bare forehead .
Here comes Sir Oliver .
Will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
Is there anyone to give the bride away ?
I don't want to take another man's second-hand goods .
No , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn't legal .
How are you , sir ?
We're glad to see you .
God bless you for being here .
I'm very glad to see you .
This is just a trifling matter here , sir .
No , no , put your hat back on .
Do you want to get married , fool ?
Just as the ox has his yoke , the horse its bridle , the falcon a tether , a man has his desires , to keep in check .
And , being a man of your breeding , you're going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar ?
Get yourself to a church and have a proper priest , who can tell you what marriage is all about , marry you .
Then one of you will warp and pull away , and there goes your marriage .
Come with me and let me advise you .
Come , sweet Audrey .
We have to be married properly .
None of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
Don't talk to me .
I'm going to cry .
Go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn't suit a man .
But don't I have good reason to cry ?
As good a reason as any .
So go ahead and cry .
His kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
I'm very glad I came to see you .
If he shows up tomorrow , I'll give him what's coming to him .
If he can manage to walk after our fight , I'll never wrestle for money again .
Farewell , my lord .
But not for long ; Charles will take care of everything .
But you heard him swear up and down that he was .
He's staying in the forest with your father now .
I met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
He laughed at that and let me go .
He writes brave poems , speaks brave words , makes brave promises , and then breaks them just as bravely .
He's like a cowardly
Who's coming here ?
Mistress and master , you've often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with , the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with .
Yes , what about him ?
Sweet Phoebe , do not scorn me .
Do not , Phoebe .
Go ahead and say you don't love me , but not so bitterly .
Faint , fall down , if you don't , then you're lying about my eyes being murderers .
Come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
But my eyes , which I've darted at you , haven't even left a mark .
Now I am sure that eyes can't hurt a person .
Oh , darling Phoebe , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face , then you'll know about the invisible wounds that love's sharp arrows can make .
Well , until that time , don't come near me .
And when that time comes , then you can mock me , but please don't pity me , because I won't pity you .
But mistress , know yourself .
Get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
Ask this man's forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
So take her , shepherd , and God bless you .
Besides , I don't like you .
Come on , sister .
And don't be proud .
The whole world could look at you , and no one would be as blind as he is , thinking you're beautiful .
Sweet Phoebe , have pity on me .
Well , I'm sorry for you , gentle Silvius .
Then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
You have my friendship .
Isn't that enough ?
I want you .
Well , that's just greedy .
But don't expect any more than that .
Do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
Not very well , but I've met him several times .
Don't think I'm in love with him just because I'm asking about him .
But what do I care about words ?
And yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
He's awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
He'll grow up to be a proper man .
He's not very tall , but he's tall enough for his age .
His legs aren't great , but they're alright .
His lips were nice and red , a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks , one was pure red and the other more pink .
What right did he have to scold me like that ?
He said my eyes and my hair were black and , now that I think of it , he scorned me .
I'm surprised I didn't bite back .
But no matter , I'll get back at him soon enough .
I'll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
Will you do that for me , Silvius ?
With all my heart , Phoebe .
I'll be bitter toward him , and curt .
Come with me , Silvius .
Please , pretty young man , I'd like to get to know you better .
They say you are a melancholy fellow .
I am .
I like it better than laughing .
People who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
Well , I think it's good to be serious and keep quiet .
In that case it's good to be a post .
I don't have the proud melancholy of a courtier or the ambitious melancholy of a soldier or the calculated melancholy of a lawyer .
You're a traveler .
Well then , you have good reason to be sad .
I'm afraid you've sold your own land to see other men's .
To have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
Not true .
And your experience makes you sad .
I'd rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad , and to travel for all that trouble , no less !
Good day and happiness to you , darling Rosalind .
My beautiful Rosalind , I'm only an hour late .
Please , Rosalind , my sweet cousin , be happy .
Dear Celia , I already look much happier than I feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
Unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn't try to teach me how to be happy .
Well , by this I can see that you don't love me as much as I love you .
If Well , I'll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
I swear I will , and if I ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
So please , my sweet Rose , my dear Rose , be happy .
From now on I will , cousin , and I'll think of all kinds of games for us .
Let me see , what do you think about falling in love ?
You'd break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
Forgive me , darling Rosalind .
No , if you're ever late like this again , I'll refuse to see you .
I'd rather be wooed by a snail .
A snail ?
Besides , he brings his fate with him .
What fate is that ?
Why , his cuckold's horns , of course , the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
See , the snail already has its horns , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife's infidelity .
A virtuous woman won't give her husband horns , and my Rosalind is definitely virtuous .
And I am your Rosalind .
Come on , woo me , woo me .
I'm in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
What would you say to me now if I really were your precious little Rosalind ?
I'd kiss you before I spoke .
No , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you've run out of things to say .
When good orators finish talking , they spit ; when lovers do ( God help us if they ever do ) , they kiss .
What if she won't kiss me ?
Who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
Indeed , you would be out if I were your mistress , if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
Aren't I your Rosalind ?
I like to pretend you are , because then it's almost like actually talking to her .
No , you won't die yourself , but only by proxy .
This world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .
Then love me , Rosalind .
Okay , I will , on Fridays and Saturdays , and the rest .
And will you have me ?
Sure , and twenty others just like you .
What's that ?
Well , aren't you a good man ?
I hope so .
And can a person ever have too much of a good thing ? , Come on , sister , you can be the priest and marry us. , Give me your hand , Orlando. , What do you say , sister ?
Please , marry us .
I do .
Okay , but when ?
Right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
Then you have to say , "I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife." I take you , Rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife .
Maybe I should ask you what right you have to take me , but I'll take you , Orlando , to be my husband .
So do all thoughts .
They have wings .
Now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
Forever and a day .
No , Orlando , men are like April when they're wooing a girl , young , and passionate , but like December once they're married and their passions have cooled .
I'll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain ; more fond of new things than an ape ; more giddy about getting what I want than a monkey .
I'll cry at nothing , and I'll always do it when you're in a good mood .
And when you want to go to sleep , I'll be up laughing like a hyena .
But will my Rosalind do this , too ?
But she is wise .
Right .
The wiser the woman , the wilder .
If you close the doors on a woman's wit , it'll fly out the window .
If you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
If you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
A man with a wife like that might ask , "Hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? " Nah , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor's bed .
You'll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
A woman who doesn't know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband's fault is hardly a woman .
Rosalind , I have to leave you for two hours .
I must join the duke for lunch .
I'll be back here with you by two o'clock .
Oh , go , leave me .
I knew you'd turn out this way .
My friends told me as much , and I knew it , too .
So , take me , death !
You'll be back at two o'clock ?
Yes , sweet Rosalind .
So beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
I'll keep my promise just as if you really were Rosalind .
So , goodbye .
Well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
Goodbye .
You have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
We should rip off your man's clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly .
Oh cousin , cousin , cousin , my sweet little cousin , I wish you knew how deep in love I am .
Or it's bottomless , at least : pour affection in one end , and it runs out the other .
Cupid , that blind bastard son of Venus , conceived from a thought and anger , born from insanity , that blind , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can't see himself , let Cupid judge how deep my love runs .
I'm telling you , Aliena , I can't stand being apart from Orlando .
I'm going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
And I'm going to sleep .
Which one of you killed the deer ?
Yes , sir .
Then sing it .
It doesn't matter if it's in tune so long as it's loud enough .
What do you say now ?
Isn't it past two o'clock ?
And I see a lot of Orlando here .
Look who's coming .
No , I swear , I don't even know what's in it .
Phoebe wrote it .
Well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
Let's go find that hussy , Fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
Oh , really ?
Well , when Nature makes a person beautiful , can't Fortune make her fall into a fire , thereby making her ugly after all ?
And even though Nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn't Fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?
Come on , you're a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
The point is that she didn't write this letter .
These are a man's words , and his handwriting .
I'm telling you , it's hers .
Why , she challenges me like a Muslim would challenge a Christian .
No , a woman's gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings .
Do you want to hear what she says ?
If you want to read it , as I haven't heard it yet , though I've heard too much of Phoebe's cruelty .
She's Phoebe-ing me .
Listen to what the tyrant says .
You call that ranting ?
You call this sneering ?
Why do you pity him ?
Follow them straight to the cottage .
Since you asked , I suppose it's not bragging to say that we are .
Orlando sends his regards to you both , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls "his Rosalind." Is that you ?
It is .
It's about who I am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
Please , tell us .
He looked to the side , and pay attention to what he saw then : under an oak tree , whose lower branches were mossy with age and top branches ancient and brittle , he saw a wretched beggar , with overgrown hair and beard , asleep on his back .
He discovered that the man was his older brother .
Oh , I've heard him talk about that brother , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive .
He turned away twice and almost left him there .
But his kindness was nobler than even his desire for revenge , his natural goodness was stronger than his need to give his brother what he deserved .
Are you his brother ?
Was it you that he rescued ?
Was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
That was me , but it's not me , I'm not ashamed to tell you what I once was , since I'm so happy to have since converted .
But what about the bloody handkerchief ?
I'll get there .
After a brief time , as he is a strong , brave man ,
Many people faint when they see blood .
There's more to it than that. , Ganymede !
Look , he's recovering .
I want to go home .
We'll take you there .
Please , will you take his arm ?
Buck up , boy !
You're a man ?
You don't have a man's courage .
It's true , I confess .
Oh , sir , someone would think I was a good fake .
Please tell your brother what a convincing show I put on .
Whoo-hoo !
That was no show .
Your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
Fake , I'm telling you .
Well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
That's what I'm doing .
But honestly , I should have been a woman .
Come on , you keep getting paler .
I'll do that , because I have to tell my brother how you forgave him , Rosalind .
I'll think of something .
But please , tell him how well I faked a faint .
Will you come with us ?
We'll get married at some point , Audrey .
Be patient .
Really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
No , he was wicked and vile .
But Audrey , there's a boy in the forest who claims you're his girl .
Here comes the man himself .
It warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
How old are you , friend ?
Twenty-five , sir .
A mature age .
Is your name William ?
Yes , it's William , sir .
A good name .
Were you born here in the forest ?
Yes sir , thank God .
Thank God" , that's a good answer .
Are you rich ?
Well , so-so .
So-so" is good , very good , an excellent answer .
And then again , it's not so good , but only so-so .
Are you wise ?
Yes sir , I'm fairly witty .
Well , that's a fine answer .
Give me your hand .
Are you educated ?
No , sir .
Then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
Everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass , the cup becomes empty .
Why , the he that will marry this woman .
Or , rather , I'll kill you , or I'll do away with you , or I'll turn your life into death and your freedom into captivity .
I'll poison you , or beat you with a club , or stab you with a sword .
I'll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
I will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
Therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
Do what he says , William .
Farewell , sir .
Our master and mistress are looking for you .
Let's go .
Hurry up , Audrey , hurry. , I'm coming , I'm coming .
Mistress , you have to go see your father .
Did they make you the messenger ?
From a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them , he swore on his honor , was bad .
Now , I'll swear to the opposite , that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine , but even so , the knight wasn't lying .
And how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
Yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
Watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that I am a knave .
By our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
And I swear by my wickedness ( if I had any ) that I am a knave .
Is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
It will be to your advantage , because I'll leave our father's house and all his property to you , while I live and die a shepherd here in the forest .
You have my consent .
You can be married tomorrow if you want .
I'll invite the duke and all of his followers .
Go get Aliena ready , because , look , here comes my Rosalind .
And hello to you , fair sister .
Oh , darling Orlando , it's so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
Actually , it's my arm .
I thought your heart had been wounded by a lion's claws .
They're in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
You couldn't beat the two of them apart .
They'll be married tomorrow , and I'll invite the duke to the ceremony .
But , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man's eyes .
Tomorrow I'll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved , in having what he wished for .
Well then , can't I act as Rosalind for you tomorrow ?
I can't live by pretending anymore .
I won't exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
You should know that I think you're a smart man .
Believe me , then , that I have special powers .
Since I was three years old , I've been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician , no black magic here .
If you love Rosalind as much as you say you do , you will marry her when your brother marries Aliena .
I know where she is and , if you don't mind , I will set her before you tomorrow , whole and unharmed .
Are you serious ?
I swear on my life , which I take pretty seriously , even if I am a magician .
Look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
I don't care .
A faithful shepherd worships you .
Silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
It means being full of sighs and tears , like I am for Phoebe .
And like I am for Ganymede .
And like I am for Rosalind .
And like I am for no woman .
It means being faithful and ready to serve , just like I am for Phoebe .
And like I am for Ganymede .
And like I am for Rosalind .
And like I am for no woman .
It means being filled with fantasy ; with passion and wishes ; with adoration , loyalty , and devotion .
And I for Rosalind .
And I for no woman .
Since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
And why do you blame me for loving you ?
Who are you talking to ?
I'm saying it to the girl who isn't here and doesn't hear me .
All right , stop this .
You sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
As long as I'm alive , I'll be here .
Me too .
Me too .
Tomorrow is the happy day , Audrey .
We'll be married tomorrow .
I hope it doesn't make me unchaste that I really want to be a married woman .
Here come two of Duke Senior's pages .
Good afternoon , good gentleman .
It really is good to see you .
Come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
Sounds good to us .
Sit between us .
Should we just get down to it ?
Yes , yes , and let's sing in unison , like two gypsies riding on a single horse .
Really , young men , though it wasn't a very hard song to get right , the music was still all out of tune .
Orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he's promised ?
Yes , even if I had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
I will , even if I were king of all kingdoms .
Yes , even if I die an hour later .
But if you decide not to marry me , you'll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
That's the deal .
Even if marrying her meant I died .
I've promised to make everything right .
Phoebe , keep your promise to marry me , and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me .
Silvius , keep your promise to marry Phoebe if she refuses me .
I'll leave now , to set all these things right .
This shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
My lord , when I first saw him I thought he was your daughter's brother .
But , my lord , this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic .
My lord , welcome this man .
This is the jester I have met so many times in the forest .
He swears he used to be a courtier .
If anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
I have bankrupted three tailors .
I have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
And how was that one settled ?
Well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
What do you mean , the seventh cause ?
I like him very well .
Tell me , who is this knight ?
A man old Frederick , your father , loves .
If he has my father's love , then that's enough honor for me .
Enough of this .
No more talk about my father ; you'll be whipped for slander one of these days .
It's a pity that fools aren't allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
Honestly , you're speaking the truth , ever since the fools were With his mouth full of news .
Which he'll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
Then we'll be stuffed with news .
Well that's good .
If we're Hello , Monsieur Le Beau .
What's the news ?
Fair princess , you've missed some good sport .
Sport ?
Of what
God bless you , sir .
This poor virgin isn't much to look at , sir , but she's mine .
Really , he's very witty , and full of wise sayings .
But back to that argument you mentioned .
What's the "seventh cause" ?
I didn't like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
He sent me word that , whether I liked it or not , he liked it fine .
They call this "the argumentative countercheck." And so on through "the circumstantial lie" and "the direct lie." And how many times did you say his beard wasn't cut well ?
He's as smart as they come , but just a jester .
He uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
There is laughter in heaven When earthly affairs are put right And people unite .
Good duke , come receive your daughter .
Hymen brought her from heaven Yes , brought her here .
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my daughter .
If my eyes don't deceive me , you are my Rosalind .
If my eyes aren't deceiving me , goodbye , love .
Quiet !
My niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
Let me have your attention for a moment .
I'm Sir Rowland's middle son , and I bring you news .
When Duke Frederick heard that great , worthy men were coming to this forest every day , he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother .
I swear on my life that I'm speaking the truth .
Do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
Yes , he has .
I will go find him .
There is much to be learned from these converts .
Stay , Jaques , stay here for a bit .
No , this fun is not for me .
I'll wait for you in your cave , where you can tell me what you need from me .
Let's proceed .
We'll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end , with delight .
If it's true that you don't need
What color , madam ?
I don't understand , how should I answer that ?
However your wit and luck allow .
Tell us about this wrestling .
Well , we've missed the beginning ; it's dead and buried .
There comes an old man with his three sons , It sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
Three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence ,
Right , and they wore proclamations around their necks , saying , "Be it known to all men by these The eldest of the three brothers wrestled with Charles , the duke's wrestler .
Charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
They're lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
Oh , dear !
But tell me , monsieur , what sport are the ladies missing ?
Why , the one I just told you about .
Me too , I swear .
Doesn't anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
Shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
Yes , I see them coming .
Let's stay and watch .
Come on .
Since the youth won't be reasoned with , he'll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
Is that the man ?
That's him , madam .
Alas , he is too young .
Yet he seems capable .
What's up , daughter and niece ?
Have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
Yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
You won't enjoy it much , I can tell you , the odds are so against this young man .
Because he's so young , I've tried to discourage him , but he won't listen .
Call him over here , good Monsieur Le Beau .
I remember , Adam , that's Here comes my master , your brother .
Go hide , Adam , and you'll hear how he abuses me .
Mister Challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
I'll wait on them with all respect and duty .
Young man , have you challenged Charles the Wrestler ?
No , lovely princess .
He is the general challenger .
I have only come in , like the others have , to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
Young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
You have seen the cruel proof of this man's strength .
If you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously .
We beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
Please , young sir .
If I'm killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead .
I won't wrong any of my friends , because I don't have any to mourn for me , and I won't have wronged the world , because I don't have anything in the world .
In this world , I'm only taking up space .
I wish I could give you the little strength that I have .
Mine too , to join hers .
Good luck .
I hope to God I'm wrong about your chances .
I hope you get what you desire !
You get only one round .
No , I'm sure your Grace won't be able to persuade him to try a second round , even though you couldn't dissuade him from trying the first .
You should mock me I wish I were invisible , so I could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
Oh , what an excellent young man !
If I could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , I can tell you who'd be on the ground .
No more , no more .
How are you doing , Charles ?
He can't speak , my lord .
Carry him away .
What is your name , young man ?
Orlando , my lord , the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys .
I wish you were someone else's son .
The whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
I wish you had told me you had a different father .
If I were my father , cousin , would I do this ?
I'm proud to be Sir Rowland's son , his youngest son , and I would never change that , not even to be Frederick's adopted heir .
My father loved Sir Rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father's opinion .
If I had known this young man was his son , I would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
Gentle cousin , let's go thank him and encourage him .
Yes .
Good luck , fair gentleman .
He's calling us back .
My Will you come on , cousin ?
I'm coming .
Farewell .
What is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
I can't speak to her , even though she asked me to .
Either Charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
Good sir , as a friend , I advise you to leave this place .
Although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you've done .
The duke is temperamental .
But I will tell you that lately the duke has been displeased with his niece , and for no other reason than that people praise her virtues and pity her for her father's sake .
Goodbye , sir .
Later , in a better world than this , I'd love to get to know you .
I'm indebted to you .
Goodbye .
Out of the frying pan and into the fire , from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
But , oh , heavenly Rosalind !
What's going on , Rosalind ?
I don't even have one to throw at a dog .
No , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
Throw some of your words at me .
Then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any .
Is all of this about your father ?
No , some of it is about my child's father .
If we walk on the well-worn paths , they won't get caught in our petticoats .
Cough them up .
I'd try it , if I could cry "hem" and have him .
Come on , take control of your feelings .
But they're siding with a better wrestler than myself .
Oh , that's a good wish !
You'll fight with him eventually , and The duke , my father , loved his father very much .
Does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
By that kind of logic , I should hate Orlando , since my father hates his father .
But I don't hate Orlando .
No , please don't hate him , for my sake .
Why shouldn't I ?
Doesn't he deserve it ?
Let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because I do .
Look , here comes the duke .
He looks angry .
Madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
Me , uncle ?
You , niece .
In ten days time , if you're found within twenty miles of the court , you'll die for it .
Please , your Grace , tell me what crime I have committed .
If I know my own thoughts and desires , and I'm not dreaming or crazy , which I'm sure I'm not , then , dear uncle , I've never had so much as a half-formed thought that would have offended you .
All traitors protest like this .
If they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent , they'd all be as innocent as God Himself .
I don't trust you .
You are your father's daughter .
That's enough .
I was his daughter when your Highness took my father's dukedom .
I was his daughter when you banished him .
My father wasn't a traitor .
So , please , my lord , don't assume that I'm treacherous just because I'm poor , with no titles to my name .
Dear master , listen to me .
Yes , Celia , we kept her here for your sake .
I was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now I know her .
If she's a traitor , why then , so am I .
You're a fool .
You will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she's out of the picture .
So be quiet .
The sentence I've passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
She is banished .
Then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
I can not live without her .
You are a fool. , You , niece , prepare to leave .
On my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
Oh , my poor Rosalind , where will you go ?
Do you want to exchange fathers ?
I'll give you mine .
I insist , don't be more distressed than I am .
I have more reason to be distressed .
Hey , you !
What are you Nothing .
I've never been taught how to make anything .
Well , then , what are you messing up ?
I'm helping Indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
Should I tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
When did I Do you know where you are , sir ?
Yes , sir , very well , I'm here in your orchard .
Do you know whom you're talking to ?
Yes , better than you know me .
I know you're my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
I have as much of our father in me as you do , though I admit you're closer to him and matter more because you're older .
No you haven't , cousin .
Please , be cheerful .
Don't you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
No , he hasn't .
Oh , he hasn't ?
Well , then , you don't have the affection that would teach you that you and I are one .
Will we be separated ?
Should we part , sweet girl ?
I swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , I'm going with you , whatever you say .
But where will we go ?
To the Forest of Arden , to find your father .
But what danger we'll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
Fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
I'll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
Wouldn't it be better , since I'm unusually tall for a woman , to dress myself like a man ?
I'll wear a big sword in my belt , carry a boar-spear in my hand , and hide all my womanish fear in my heart .
What should I call you when you're a man ?
I'll take no lesser name than that of Something that refers to my current state .
Instead of Celia , call me Aliena .
Wouldn't he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
Let's go gather our jewels and money .
We'll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father's guards , whom he'll send out as soon as he discovers I've gone .
Now , we go contentedly to freedom , not banishment .
Now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn't experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance ?
Aren't these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
I smile and think , "Thank goodness the wind doesn't flatter me : it's like a councilor who makes me feel what I'm really made of." Adversity can have its benefits , like the ugly , poisonous I wouldn't change my situation for anything .
You're lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
Come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
It bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city's native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
Indeed , my lord , the gloomy Jaques grieves over these deaths .
Big , round tears ran piteously down the animal's innocent nose .
And did you leave him like this ?
We did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
Take me to him .
I love to argue with him when he's having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
I'll bring you to him right away .
Can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
It can not be .
Some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
I can't find anyone who saw her leave .
Her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
My lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
Send a message to his brother .
Bring that swinger Orlando here .
If he's not around , bring his brother Oliver to me .
I'll make Oliver find him .
Do this immediately , and don't stop searching and interrogating until you've brought home these foolish runaways .
Who's there ?
What are you doing here ?
Why are you so strong and good ?
Why do people love you ?
And why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
Why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke's favorite champion ?
Your praise has beaten you home .
Don't you know , master , that some men's best qualities do them in ?
Oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
Why , what's the matter ?
In this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
Oliver , your brother , no , not your brother ; and yet he's the son , but no , I won't call him the son , of that great man I was about to call his father , has heard about how well you did in the wrestling match , and tonight he's planning on burning your house down , with you in it .
And if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
I overheard him and his plans .
This is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
Hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
Then where would you have me go , Adam ?
It doesn't matter where , so long as it's not here .
What , would you have me beg for my food ?
This is all that's left for me to do , but I won't do it .
I'd rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
But don't do that .
Let me be your servant .
I know I may be old , but I'm strong and healthy , because in my youth I never drank nor lived recklessly .
Therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
Let me go with you .
I'll do everything a younger man could do for you .
Oh , good old man , you're a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money .
Come along , though .
We'll go together , and before we've spent all the savings of your youth , we'll find a way to make a living .
Go on , master , and I will follow you , with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
From the time I was seventeen , over sixty years ago , I have lived in this house , but now I will live here no more .
Many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it's a bit late .
But fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
Oh Lord , my spirits are tired !
I wouldn't care about my spirits , if my legs weren't tired .
I can't go any further .
I'd rather bear with you than Well , this is the Forest of Arden .
Yes , now I'm in Arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
Yes , be content , good Touchstone .
Look who's coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
What , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
I'm no villain .
If you weren't my brother , I'd leave this hand of mine on your neck until I'd pulled out your tongue for talking like this .
You've only insulted yourself .
Gentlemen , calm down .
For the sake of your father's memory , make peace .
Let me go , I say .
I won't until I'm ready .
You will listen to me .
My father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
But you've raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what I needed to become a gentleman .
My father's spirit is growing in me , and I won't take this any longer .
And what are you going to do after you've spent your money ?
Well , sir , go inside .
I'm not going to be bothered by you for long .
You'll get some of what you want .
Now please leave me alone .
What you're doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
Oh , Corin , I wish you could understand how much I love her !
I'm sure I can guess .
No Corin , since you're old , you can not guess , even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was , sighing and mooning all night long .
If your love was anything like mine , and I'm sure that no man has loved as I love now , exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to ?
Oh , a thousand of them , all of which I've forgotten .
Oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
If you can't remember the stupidest little thing love made you do , you haven't loved .
Or if you haven't sat as I do now , boring your listener with all your lover's virtues , then you haven't loved .
Or if you haven't broken away from human company , as my feelings now lead me to do , you haven't loved .
O Phoebe , Phoebe , Phoebe !
Oh , poor shepherd !
Me too .
I remember when I was in love , I broke my sword on a stone , and told him to take that for coming at night to see Jane Smile .
I remember kissing her washing stick and the cow's udders that her pretty , chapped hands had milked .
I remember wooing a pea plant in her name , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them "for my sake." Those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things .
But everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
You speak more wisely than you know .
Nah , I'll never be aware of my own wit , until I break my shins on it .
By God !
And like mine , but I'm getting a little tired of it .
Please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
Shut up , fool .
He's not your relative .
Who's calling ?
Your superiors .
Please sir , if love or money can buy anything in this empty place , tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves .
Dear sir , I pity the lady and wish , more for her sake than my own , that I was more able to help her .
But I'm a hired hand : I don't profit from the flocks I tend .
Besides , his cottage , his flocks , and his grazing rights are on sale now , and since he's not there , there's nothing to eat at our house .
Who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
That young man who was just here .
Please , if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man , buy the cottage , pasture , and flock for us , and we'll pay you for it .
And we will raise your wages .
The thing is definitely going to be sold .
Come with me .
If you like what you see of the land , the profit that's possible , and this rustic life , I'll be your faithful servant , and buy the place with your gold right away .
More , more , please , more .
It's only going to make you sad , Monsieur Jaques .
I'm glad about that .
More , please , more .
I can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
More , please , more .
My voice is ragged .
I know I won't please you .
Come on , another stanza , is that what you call 'em , "stanzas" ?
Nah , I don't care what their
Well then , if I've ever thanked a man , I'll thank you now .
But two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
The duke will drink under this tree. , He's been looking for you all day , you know .
And I've been avoiding him all day .
He's too argumentative for me .
I think of as many things as he does , but I just thank heaven and don't show off about it .
Come , warble for me .
I wrote a verse to this tune , though it's not very imaginative .
Dear master , I can't go any farther .
Oh , I'm dying of hunger .
I'll lie down here and measure out my grave .
Farewell , kind master .
Hey , what's this , Adam ?
No braver than this ?
Live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
If I can find any animal in this wild forest , I'll either be food for it or bring it as food for you .
You're not as close to death as you think you are .
I'll be back soon , and if I haven't brought you anything to eat , I will give you permission to die .
But if you die before I return , you'll have made a mockery of my efforts .
There we go !
You look happier already , and I'll be back quickly .
But you're lying out in the cold .
Cheer up , good Adam .
I think he must have turned into an animal , because I can't find him anywhere looking like a man .
My lord , he just left here .
He was happy here , listening to a song .
If that man , who's made up of conflicts , becomes musical , then there must be something wrong with the universe .
Go find him .
Tell him I want to speak with him .
He saved me the trouble : here he comes .
Well , what's going on , mister ?
What kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
What , you look amused .
Then he pulled a watch from his bag and , looking at it solemnly , said , "It's ten o'clock .
This way , we can see how the world moves .
Only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
Oh , noble fool !
A worthy fool !
Motley is the only thing to wear .
Who is this fool ?
A worthy fool !
God bless my old master .
He would never have spoken to me like this .
Is that how it's going to be ?
Are you starting to challenge me ?
I'll cure you of your insolence , and I'm not going to give you a thousand crowns , either ! , Hey , Dennis !
Did you call for me , your Worship ?
Wasn't Charles , the duke's wrestler , here to speak with me ?
Yes , sir , he's here at the door right now and asks to see you .
Call him in .
I have a good plan .
Like the wind , I must have the freedom to blast anyone I please , as fools do .
And whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
Why , sir , must he ?
Well , it's as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
Dress me up in motley .
Let me speak my mind , and I'll rid the world of its sickness , if it will only tolerate my medicine .
To hell with you !
I know what you'd do .
What would I do besides good ?
You would be committing a wicked sin by chiding other people for sinning , because you yourself have been a terrible sinner , as carnal in your appetites as lust itself , and all the swollen pustules of sin that you acquired in your freedom you now want to burst and shoot back into the world at large .
Who can say I mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
And when some lowlife protests that Stop , and eat no more .
But I haven't eaten anything yet .
And you won't until the needy eat .
What kind of fighting cock is this ?
Are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
You were right the first time .
But stop , I say .
If you won't listen to reason , I'll have to die .
What would you like ?
Gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
I'm dying for food , so let me have some .
Sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
Do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
I beg your pardon .
I thought everything out here was wild , which is why I acted so stern and commanding .
We have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men's feasts and cried tears of pity , therefore , sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs .
Then please , put off your eating for a little while I , like a mother doe , find my fawn and bring it food .
There is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
Thank you , and God bless you for your hospitality .
You see , we're not alone in our unhappiness .
The whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
They have their exits and their entrances , and in his lifetime a man will play many parts , his life separated into seven acts .
In the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse's arms .
Then he's the whining schoolboy , with a book bag and a bright , young face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school .
He's full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes : that's the way he plays his part .
Welcome .
Set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
I thank you very much on his behalf .
Welcome .
Eat .
I won't trouble you yet with questions about your situation. , Some music , please , and , good friend , sing .
Time's not the one in debt .
Your logic is so foolish .
Take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
Every person I meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
Some of them give me money , some invite me places , some thank me for the kind things I've done for them , some try to sell me things .
Just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
These are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
Here's the money you wanted , master .
Who's this Adam you speak of ?
Not the Adam from the garden of Eden , but the Adam from the jailhouse .
I don't know what you're talking about .
No ?
You mean an officer ?
Yes , the leader of the team ; the one that gets you if you can't pay a debt ; the one who assumes people are always going to bed and says to them , "Have arrest." Well , sir , stop your joking there .
Are any ships leaving tonight ?
Can we go ?
Please , somebody , get us out of here !
Good to see you , Master Antipholus .
I see you've met with the jeweler .
Is that chain you're wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
Get away from me , Satan !
Don't try to tempt me !
Master , is this Satan's mistress ?
She's the devil .
No , she's worse : she's the devil's mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
But fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
You and your servant are very funny , sir .
Will you come with me ?
Can we finish our lunch ?
Master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
Why , Dromio ?
Some Now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
I hope you're not trying to cheat me .
Come , Dromio , let's go .
Mistress , you know about that .
Antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
He has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
Now he won't give me either .
The reason I think he's insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house .
His wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he's having .
I must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring .
It's my best option : I can't afford to lose forty ducats .
I've spent five years in the remotest parts of Greece and roaming all over Asia .
However , I'll do what I can for you .
I will allow you one day to look for help in Ephesus .
I will .
Don't worry , man , I won't try to escape .
I tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
Here's my servant .
I think he's got the money .
Hello there , sir !
Do you have what I told you to get ?
Yes .
But where's the money ?
Why , sir , I spent it on this rope .
I can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
Why did I just send you home ?
And here I am , with that piece .
And I'll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
Good sir , calm down .
Hold your tongue .
No , you should tell him to hold his hands !
I wish I were senseless , sir , so that I wouldn't feel your punches !
The only thing you can sense are punches , just like an ass .
I am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
I figure that once he's crippled me , I'll beg by showing off my beatings .
That's enough .
My wife's coming .
Mistress , think about your end , beware of your death !
EPHESUS Now what do you think ?
Your husband's mad , isn't he ?
He's trembling in his fit !
I demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
Shut up , you doddering old wizard !
I'm not possessed !
Oh , I wish you weren't , you poor , frightened soul .
Listen , hussy , is this man one of your customers ?
Did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house ?
Ate at home ?
You there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
I swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
My doors were locked and I was shut out , right ?
By God , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
And she screamed at me , right ?
No lie , she screamed at you .
And her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
And I departed in a rage , right ?
You truly did .
Good idea .
I gave it to Dromio , who rushed in for it .
You gave money to me ?
Didn't you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
He did , and I gave it to him .
And I saw her do it .
I was sent for a rope !
Mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
I can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
We must tie them up and leave them in some dark room .
My sweet husband , I did not lock you out .
And my sweet master , I received no gold .
But I agree , sir , that we were locked out .
Keep him away from me !
We need more help !
The devil in him is strong !
jailer , i'm your prisoner .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
Gentlemen , let go of him .
He's my prisoner and you can't have him .
Tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
He's my prisoner .
If I let him go , I'll have to pay his bail fees myself .
I'll pay you .
Take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
What a horrible day !
What a horrible slut !
Master , I'm all tied up for you .
The poor souls , how strangely they talk !
Angelo , the jeweler .
Do you know him ?
I know him .
Two hundred ducats .
For what ?
For a necklace your husband had him make .
He said he was going to buy me a necklace , but I never saw it .
I need to hear the truth about all this .
God have mercy on us !
And they've got their swords unsheathed !
Let's call for help and get them tied up again !
Let's get out of here !
They'll kill us !
It looks like these witches are scared of swords .
The one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
I wish we were safely on board our ship already .
Look , let's stay here tonight .
Nobody will hurt us .
You see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
I think this country is so kind that if it weren't for
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me , I could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself .
I wouldn't stay here tonight for the entire town .
Go and get our stuff onto the ship .
What's this man's reputation like here in the city ?
I'd trust him with everything I own .
You're right .
And that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn't have !
Good sir , stay close to me .
So , tell people that you're from Epidamnum-otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
Here's the money you asked me to hold .
Dromio , bring this money to the Centaur Inn , where we're lodging , and wait there until I come .
It'll be lunchtime within an hour .
Until then , I'll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then I'll return and sleep at the inn .
Get going now .
Many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
Often , when I'm dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .
Listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
But if
I got it from you , I never said I didn't .
Yes , you did , sir .
Who heard me do that ?
My own ears heard it , and you know it .
To hell with you !
It's a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
You're a villain to say this about me .
I'll prove that I'm an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .
I do dare , and I say that you are the villain .
Run , master , run .
For God's sake , find a house to duck into .
This looks like an abbey .
Go in , or we're done for .
Be quiet , people !
Why have you come here in such a mob ?
To get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
Let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
How long has he been possessed like this ?
This week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
But it wasn't until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
That's a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
Which of these bad things happened to him ?
You should have reprimanded him for that .
I did .
Fine , but you weren't harsh enough .
You scolded him in private ?
And in public too .
Fine , but not enough .
He couldn't eat without me talking about it .
All I ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
And that's why he went crazy .
A jealous woman's poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .
You seasoned his food with screams .
Fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
Ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
What I'm saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
Gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
Then have your servants bring him out .
Healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
Therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
Be quiet and depart .
You're not going to take him .
Go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
Come with me .
I'll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey .
It's almost five o'clock .
To see an elderly , unlucky merchant from Syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to Ephesus .
Here they come .
We will watch the execution .
Kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
One more time , we proclaim this publicly : If anyone will pay this man's bail , he will not be put to death .
Duke , the abbess has wronged me and I seek justice .
She's a virtuous and holy lady .
She can't possibly have done you any wrong .
So please , most gracious duke , order her to bring him out so we can get him some help .
And when you married him and made him the master of your bed , I gave you my word that I would do everything I possibly could for him .
Shut up , fool !
Your master and his servant are here .
Mistress , I swear on my life that it's true .
It was just moments ago .
He's crying out for you and swears he'll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you .
Oh , my , it's my husband .
Look , he can become invisible .
Just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he's over there .
In exchange for the blood I shed for you then , I ask you for justice now .
The things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
Today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
That's terrible !
No , my good lord .
I ate with him and my sister .
Damn my soul if these accusations are true !
If she's lying , I pray that I never sleep again at night or wake up during the day .
Oh , lying woman !
My lord , I know what I'm saying .
He left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the Porcupine , where I was dining with Balthasar .
He hadn't arrived by the time we finished eating , so I went out looking for him .
I met him in the street , he was there with that man .
On the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
One of them was a man named Pinch : a hungry , narrow-faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller ; a needy , hollow-eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
He pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
They left me and my servant there , tied together .
He did , my lord .
I never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
Why , what a complicated case this is !
it pleases you , I'll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .
Right now , my pressing business calls me away .
Farewell till then .
I will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
Sir , I leave you to your own contentment .
He leaves me to my own contentment , but that's the one thing I can not find .
Out in the world , I'm like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .
In order to find a mother and a brother , I too have lost myself , unhappily .
How is it that you've come back so soon ?
Back so soon ?
Too late is more like it .
The chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn't .
Sir , he ate with this woman at the Porcupine .
He did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
That's true , my lord : I did get this ring from her .
Did you see him enter this abbey ?
As clearly as I see you , my lord .
I think you're all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
Mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
I think I see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
I was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
Now I'm Dromio and no longer attached to him .
I'm sure you both remember me .
You're not one of Pinch's patients , are you , sir ?
Why are you looking at me so strangely ?
You know me well .
I never saw you before in my life .
Oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
But tell me this : don't you know my voice ?
No .
Don't you , Dromio ?
No sir , trust me , I do not .
You don't know my voice ?
Have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak , sorrow-ravaged voice ?
But I still have a little memory left , and there's still some fire in my eyes ; my dull , deaf ears can still hear a little .
All these aging faculties tell me , and I can not be wrong , that you are my son , Antipholus .
I never saw my father in my life .
You know that we parted only seven years ago , in Syracuse .
Your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
Mighty duke , look here and see a man who's been treated most terribly !
Either my eyes deceive me , or I see two husbands .
I , sir , am Dromio .
Command this man to leave .
I , sir , am Dromio .
Pray , let me stay .
Oh , my old master ! , Who tied him up ?
Tell us , old Egeon : are you the man who once had a wife named Emilia , who gave birth to two fair sons ?
Oh , if you are the same Egeon , speak now , and speak to that same Emilia !
These two Antipholuses , who look so alike , and these two Dromios , who seem to have the same face , and her story of being shipwrecked , why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
If I'm not dreaming , you are Emilia .
If it's really you , tell me what happened to our son , who floated away with you on that deadly raft .
Antipholus , aren't you originally from Corinth ?
Wait , don't stand next to each other .
I can't tell who's who .
I came from Corinth , Your Highness .
And I came with him .
Your renowned uncle , Duke Menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
Which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
I did , kind lady .
And you're my husband , right ?
That's the necklace I gave you , sir .
I think it is , sir .
I don't deny it .
And you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
I think I did , sir .
I don't deny it .
I sent Dromio to you with money for bail , but I don't think he brought it to you .
No , he didn't get any by me .
I got this purse full of money from you , and my Dromio brought it to me .
I want to use this money to set my father free .
That's not necessary .
I'm going to let him live .
Sir , I must get that diamond ring back from you .
There , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
Renowned duke , please join us in the abbey , where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us .
Duke Solinus , my husband , and both my children , and you two Dromios , who marked the day of my sons ' births with your own , come into the abbey with me for a new christening .
After such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
With all my heart , I'll join you .
Dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
The stuff you had at the Centaur , sir .
I'm your master , Dromio .
You have a fat friend at your master's house : she took care of me in the kitchen today , thinking I was you .
I guess now she's going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
I think you're my mirror , not my brother .
Do you want to go in and join the party ?
After you , sir .
You're older than me .
That's a good point .
How can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
We'll draw straws .
Meanwhile , after you .
We came into the world as brother and brother , so now let's enter hand in hand , not one before the other .
Hold on a second .
Answer me this , please : where's the money I gave you ?
Oh , the sixpence you gave me last Wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
The saddle maker has it , sir , I didn't keep it .
I'm not in a joking mood .
Tell me right now and stop fooling : where's the money ?
We're strangers here .
Please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
I should think that your appetite would act like a clock ( as mine does ) and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
That's enough , Dromio , please .
This isn't a good moment for jokes , save them till a happier time .
Where's the gold I gave you ?
Gave me , sir ?
You didn't give me any gold .
Tell me what you've done with the money I entrusted to you .
The only thing that I've been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house , the Phoenix , for lunch .
My mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
Tell me where you've stowed away my money , or I swear I'll break that comical head of yours for goofing when I'm not in the mood .
Where are the thousand
Your mistress's marks ?
What mistress do you have ?
What , are you going to mock me to my face when I told you not to ?
There , take that , you scoundrel !
What are you doing ?
Stop , for God's sake !
Well , if you don't , then I'm out of here .
I swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
They say that this town is full of deception , illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast-talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins .
Neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though I sent the slave off running .
Surely , Luciana , it's already two o'clock .
Maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
Sister , let's eat and stop worrying .
A man is master of his own freedom : time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he'll come or go as he pleases .
If this is so , be patient , sister .
Why should men be more free than women ?
Because their business lies outside the home .
Why , too much freedom leads to woe .
Therefore , you should obey their wishes .
It's this servantlike mentality that's keeping you unmarried .
No , that's not it , it's because of what happens in the marriage bed .
But if you were married , you'd wield some influence .
Before I learn how to love , I'll learn how to follow orders .
What if your husband strays elsewhere ?
I'd endure it until he came home again .
Now that's patience !
No wonder she's waiting to get married .
When we're faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up .
But if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
Well , I'll get married one day , just to see .
Tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
Do you know his plans ?
But please , tell me : is he coming home ?
It seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
Why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
You bastard !
I don't mean he's
My mistress , " I said .
Damn your mistress !
My master said it .
I don't know , " he said , "any house , wife , or mistress." My message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders .
Go back again , slave , and bring him home .
Go back again , to be beaten home again ?
For God's sake , send somebody else .
Go back , slave , or I'll knock you one across the head .
Get out of here , you blathering peasant !
Bring your master home .
You kick me out , he kicks me back .
Look at you !
You have impatience all over your face .
He feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while I sit at home starving for a smile from him .
Has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
Have I lost my wit ?
One smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
But like an unruly deer , he's always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures .
I am nothing but a poor , used fool .
Drive it out of you .
I know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn't he be here ?
Sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
I would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
Even the best jewel can be tarnished .
And no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
Since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , I'll weep away what's left and then die with weeping .
How many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
Give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
Ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you Syracusians and we Ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .
No-the law goes further : if anyone born in Ephesus is seen in Syracuse's marketplaces or if anyone born in Syracuse comes to Ephesus , that man dies , and his possessions will be confiscated by the Duke , unless he can raise a thousand marks to pay the penalty and ransom himself .
Therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
The gold I gave Dromio is safe and sound at the Centaur , and the inn host says that Dromio has left and is looking for me .
I haven't spoken to him since I sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
Here he comes .
So , sir .
Are you over your ridiculous mood ?
You never heard of the Centaur ?
You weren't given any gold ?
Your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
The Phoenix is my house ?
Were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
Said what , sir ?
When did I say all that ?
I haven't seen you since you sent me to the Centaur with the gold you gave me .
And I hope you realized I wasn't very happy about it .
I'm glad to see you in such a merry mood .
But what's the joke ?
Please , master , tell me .
What , are you mocking me to my face ?
Here .
Take that , and that !
Stop , sir , for God's sake !
Now this joke has turned serious .
Why are you doing this ?
Just because I act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection .
You call it my " Don't you know ?
Should I tell you why ?
Well , thank you .
Because you gave me something for nothing .
Next time I'll give you nothing for something .
Is it lunchtime ?
What would that be ?
A basting .
Well , then it will be dry .
If it is , I suggest you don't eat it .
Why not ?
Because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
Well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
There's a time for all things .
Before you got so angry , I never would have thought that .
Why not ?
I'll tell you : it's because of a law as plain as Father Time's bald head .
Let's hear it .
There may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
Why is Time so cheap about giving out hair ?
But a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
So then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
Two reasons .
And good ones , too .
Not good ones , please .
Then sure ones .
No , not sure ones when we're talking about something unsure .
Then certain ones .
Name them .
One , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it doesn't land in their dinner .
You were supposed to be proving that there isn't time for everything .
Then I'll change it to this : Father Time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .
There was a time when you'd freely tell me that words were never music to your ear unless I said them , that objects never pleased your eye unless I showed them to you , that touches never pleased your hands unless they were my touches , and that food never tasted sweet to you unless I had prepared it .
How is it , my husband , oh , how is it , that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
Ah , don't tear yourself away from me !
I don't know you .
Why are you treating my sister like this ?
She sent Dromio to bring you home for lunch .
Dromio ?
And this is what you told me he said : that he beat you and pretended his house wasn't his and I wasn't his wife .
Did you talk with this woman ?
What kind of scheme do you have going together ?
Me , sir ?
I never saw her till now .
You said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
I never talked with her in my life .
What , was I married to her in a dream ?
Or am I asleep now and imagining all this ?
What is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
Until I know for sure , I'll humor her .
Dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
Oh , I wish I had my rosary !
I'll cross myself .
This must be some kind of fairyland .
Oh , spite of spites !
If we don't obey them , they'll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue .
Why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order I gave you ?
Dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
I've been transformed somehow , haven't I , master ?
No , master , I've been changed in both mind and body .
That's true .
I must be as stupid as an ass , that's why I don't know her , but she knows me .
I won't play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .
Come , husband , let's go to lunch .
Husband , I'll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you've pulled .
Am I on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
know myself !
Master , should I watch the door ?
Yes , and don't let anyone come in , or else I'll break your head .
Well , Syracusian , tell us-briefly-why you left your hometown and came to Ephesus .
And yet I would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
In the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
Reluctantly , I agreed-alas !
Too quickly , we boarded a ship .
Signior Angelo , please excuse us .
Here's the story we'll tell her : that I was with you at your shop , watching you make her necklace , and that you're going to deliver it tomorrow .
But here comes a scoundrel who says he saw me at the marketplace and that I beat on him , told him I'd given him a thousand marks in gold , and then lied about my wife and my house .
Say what you want , but I know what I know .
I think you're an ass .
Signior Balthasar , you look upset .
Your delicacies aren't worth as much to me as your welcome is .
Good food's not a big deal , everyone can afford that .
And everyone can say "welcome , " which is just a word .
A little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
Sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
But look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
You may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
What's this ?
My door is locked .
Maud , Bridget , Marian , Ciceley , Gillian , Ginn !
My master is standing out in the street !
Who's in there ?
Hey , open the door !
A reason ?
So I can eat lunch .
I haven't eaten today .
Who do you think you are , keeping me out of my own house ?
You've stolen both my job and my name !
Oh , Lord , this makes me laugh !
I'll come at you with the old proverb : "Should I make myself at home ? "
Listen up , you slave .
Are you going to let us in ?
Come , help me bang on the door , master .
Well done !
We answered them , blow for blow .
You good-for-nothing , let me in .
Master , knock hard upon the door .
If I break the door down , slave , you'll be sorry for this .
Is that you , wife ?
You could have come sooner .
If she punishes you , master , she's sure to punish me .
We argued about which was best , and now we won't get either one .
And if your clothes were as thin as mine , you'd really feel the air .
The food inside is warm , but you're out here freezing .
It would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
Go get me something I can use to break down the door .
I've had enough of this "off with you ! " Come on , let me in !
Well , I'm going to break in .
Go get me a crow .
A crow without feathers ?
Master , do you really mean that ?
I meant a crowbar .
Get going already .
Be patient , sir !
Don't do this !
All this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
Let's assume that she has a reason , which you don't know yet : have faith that she'll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today .
You're right , I'll go quietly .
And even though I'm in a distasteful mood , I'll work on being happy .
I know a terrific wench .
We'll eat at her place .
I swear to her that I haven't , but it doesn't change anything .
I'll meet you there in an hour .
Do that .
This little prank of hers is going to cost me .
Is the building of your love already in ruins ?
If you married my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth's sake , treat her with more kindness .
What foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
It's doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes .
We follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
So , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
Sweet mistress , I don't know what other name to give you , or how you've figured out mine , you seem as
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
Teach me how I should think and speak .
Why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction ?
Are you a god ?
Are you trying to remake me ?
Go ahead , I'll yield to your power .
But if I am myself , then I know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
I don't owe her any duty , it's you that I submit to .
Oh , sweet mermaid , don't command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister's tears .
Are you insane , talking like this ?
Your eyes are playing tricks on you .
That's because you are near me , and you're as dazzling as the sun .
Why are you calling me "love" ?
Call my sister that .
Your sister's sister .
That's my sister .
My food , my fortune , my sweetest hope , my heaven on earth , and my entrance to heaven .
My sister is all those things , or else she should be .
Call yourself your own sister , because I want you .
Give me your hand .
Oh , wait , sir .
Stay here .
I'll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
What's going on , Dromio ?
Where are you running so fast ?
Do you know me ?
Am I Dromio ?
Am I your servant ?
Am I myself ?
It carried us toward Corinth-or so we thought .
But before they reached us-let me say no more !
You are Dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
I'm an ass , I'm a woman's servant , and I'm beside myself .
What woman's servant ?
What do you mean , beside yourself ?
How does she claim to own you ?
I don't mean that she wants me because What's she like ?
The only thing I could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by .
Her
Even if she lives till the end of the world , she'd keep burning an additional week .
What's her skin like ?
It's dark , like my shoe .
Some water will fix that .
No , it's permanent .
What's her name ?
Nell .
She's round , like a globe .
What part of her body is Ireland ?
Her bottom .
Honestly , I didn't see it , but I felt it in her hot breath .
Where's America and the West Indies ?
Oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
And I think that if I hadn't been brave and strong , she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave .
If there's enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight , I won't spend tonight in this town .
If a ship's leaving , come to the marketplace .
If everyone here knows us but we don't know anybody , it's time , I think , for us to pack our bags and take off .
I'll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as I'd run from a bear .
That means it's high time for me to go .
That woman who claims I am her husband , I loathe her in my soul .
I'd better stop up my ears against this siren's song .
I know that , sir .
Look , here's the necklace .
What do you want me to do with this ?
Whatever you want , I made it for you .
Made it for me ?
I didn't order it .
You did , not just once or twice , but twenty times .
You're a funny man , sir .
Take care .
I don't know what to think about this .
I'll go wait for Dromio at the marketplace .
If any ships are sailing , I'll get right on one .
Antipholus owes me the exact amount that I owe you .
At five o'clock he's going to pay me for it .
Please , come to his house with me .
The total due is about three ducats more than I owe this gentleman .
Please , pay him immediately .
I don't have the cash right now .
Besides , I have some business to take care of in town .
So you'll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
All right , sir , I will .
Do you have it with you ?
Listen , please , give me the necklace .
The wind is right and it's high tide , and I've delayed him a long time already .
Good Lord !
You're using this as an excuse for not showing up at the Porcupine like you promised .
I should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
It's getting late .
Please , sir , hurry up .
Antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
Give me the necklace !
Give it to my wife , and get your money .
Come , come .
You know I gave it to you just now .
Send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
Damn it , this isn't funny .
Where's the necklace ?
Let me see it .
Pay you ?
What should I pay you ?
The money you owe me for the necklace .
I owe you nothing until I receive the necklace .
You know that I gave it to you a half hour ago .
You wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
Consider how poorly this reflects on me .
I will .
This harms my reputation .
Pay for something I never got ?
Go ahead , you fool .
Arrest me if you dare .
I would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
You're under arrest , sir .
You hear the charges .
I'll obey you until I can make bail .
But Angelo , you'll pay for this , even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop .
Sir , the laws of Ephesus will be on my side , and you'll be embarrassed .
No , keep going , old man ; don't stop like that .
For we may take pity on you , even if we can't pardon you .
Had the gods taken pity on us , I wouldn't be here calling them merciless .
It's been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
And for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
I've left our luggage on the ship , and I bought the oil , balm , and liquor you wanted .
You annoying idiot , what Epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
A ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
You drunken slave , I sent you for a rope , and I told you what to do with it .
Yeah , right , you sent me to get whipped .
You sent me to the port to find a ship .
I'll debate this with you later , and then I'll teach you to listen more carefully .
Go to Adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
Give her this key , and tell her that there's money in the desk that's covered with a Turkish tapestry .
Have her send it to me .
Tell her that I've been arrested and the money will be my bail .
Hurry , you slave !
Go !
To Adriana ?
Where that "sweetheart" said I was her husband !
She's too much for me to handle .
But I must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
Oh , Luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
Sad or happy ?
First , he said you had no right to him .
He meant he did nothing right for me , which is true , unfortunately .
Then he swore he was a stranger here .
And that's true , he Then I pleaded for you .
And what did he say ?
That he felt for me the love that I begged him to feel for you .
How did he try to persuade you to love him ?
Have some patience , please .
Then why be jealous of a person like that ?
When an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
Oh , but I think of him more highly than I say I do , and I wish he looked worse in other women's eyes .
My heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
How did you lose your breath ?
By running fast .
Where's your master , Dromio ?
Is he all right ?
No , he's in a place worse than hell .
A backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
Speak , man , what's the matter ?
Tell me , who had him arrested ?
I don't know who had him arrested , but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather .
Get it , sister .
How could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
Don't you hear it ring ?
What , the necklace ?
No , no , the bell .
It's time for me to go .
It was two o'clock when I left him , and now it's one .
I've never heard of that .
Of course .
You sell fish .
No , not me , sir .
In that case I wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
Good , sir ?
Yes , sir .
Only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
That's definitely true , my lord .
Since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse , by the way , do you have a daughter ?
I do indeed , my lord .
Then by all means never let her walk in public .
Procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant , look out , friend .
A lot of words .
And what is the subject ?
Between whom ?
I mean , what do the words say ?
Oh , just lies , sir .
Into my grave .
Well , that's certainly out of this world , all right .
You can't take anything from me that I care less about , except my life , except my life , except my life .
Good-bye , my lord .
You're looking for Lord Hamlet .
He's right over there .
Thank you , sir .
My lord !
My dear sir !
Ah , my good old friends !
How are you , Guildenstern ?
And Rosencrantz !
Boys , how are you both doing ?
Happy that we're not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
But you're not down and out , either , are you ?
So you're around Lady Luck's waist ?
Yes , we're the privates in her army .
Anyway , what's up ?
But you're wrong .
Let me ask you a particular question .
What crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
Prison , my lord ?
Denmark's a prison .
Then I guess the whole world is one .
Yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , Denmark being one of the worst .
We don't think so , my lord .
Well , then it isn't one to you , since nothing is really good or bad in itself , it's all what a person thinks about it .
And to me , Denmark is a prison .
That must be because you're so ambitious .
It's too small for your large mind .
Dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
But a dream itself is just a shadow .
In fact , I consider ambition to be so light and airy that it's only the shadow of a shadow .
Then I guess beggars are the ones with bodies , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .
Should we go inside ?
Well , then , I thank you , though I'm such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much .
Or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
What should we say , my lord ?
You were sent for .
I know the king and queen sent for you .
Why would they do that , my lord ?
That's what I want you to tell me .
My lord , we were sent for .
Is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
Who can explain this to me ?
I can .
Or at least I can describe the rumors .
So why did you laugh when I said that men don't interest me ?
The one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
The adventurous knight will wave around his sword and shield , the lover will be rewarded for his sighs , the crazy character can rant all he wants , the clown will make everybody laugh , and the lady character can say whatever's on her mind , or I'll stop the play .
Which troupe is it ?
The tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
What are they doing on the road ?
They made more money and got more attention in the city .
But things have changed there , and it's easier for them on the road now .
Are they as popular as they used to be when I lived in the city ?
Do they attract big audiences ?
No , not like before .
Why ?
Are they getting rusty ?
No , they're busy and as excellent as ever .
The problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it .
These child actors are now in fashion , and they've so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all , they're so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys .
What , you mean kid actors ?
Who takes care of them ?
Who pays their way ?
Will they stop working when their voices mature ?
Aren't the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors , which they are going to grow up and become ?
There's been a whole debate on the topic .
For a while , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children's playwright and the actors playing adult roles .
Are you kidding ?
Oh , there's been a lot of quarreling .
And the boys are winning so far ?
Actually , it's not so unusual when you think about it .
My uncle is king of Denmark , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him .
There's something downright unnatural about it , if a philosopher stopped to think about it .
The actors are here .
Gentlemen , welcome to Elsinore .
Don't be shy , shake hands with me .
And if we don't shake hands , when I act all nice to the players it will seem like I'm happier to see them than you .
You are very welcome here .
But still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
In what sense , my lord ?
I'm only crazy sometimes .
At other times , I know what's what .
Gentlemen , I hope you are well .
Listen , Guildenstern , and you too , Rosencrantz , listen as close as you can !
Yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
My lord , I have news for you .
My lord , I have news for you .
When Roscius was an actor in ancient Rome , The actors have arrived , my lord .
Yawn , snore .
I swear , , each actor arrived on his ass .
Well , Aren't I right , Jephthah , old man ?
If you're calling me Jephthah , my lord , I do have a daughter I love more than anything , yes .
What is logical , then , my lord ?
Why ,
Welcome , welcome to all of you .
Which speech , my lord ?
But the critics and I found it to be an excellent play , with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy .
I loved one speech in particular .
This speech is going on too long .
We'll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
The muffled queen" ?
That's good .
The muffled queen" is good .
Look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
My lord , I will give them all they deserve .
Good heavens , man , give them more than that !
Treat them with honor and dignity .
The less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
Lead them inside .
Come , everyone .
Follow him , friends .
We'll watch a whole play tomorrow .
Yes , my lord .
Then we'll see that tomorrow night .
By the way , if I were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow , right ?
Yes , my lord .
Very well .
Follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
My good friends , I'll see you tomorrow .
Welcome to Elsinore .
Yes , my lord .
Now I'm alone .
Oh , what a mean low-life I am !
For Hecuba !
The ghost is definitely something to worry about .
In the high and mighty Roman Empire , just before the emperor Julius Caesar was assassinated , corpses rose out of their graves and ran through the streets of Rome speaking gibberish .
Wait , look !
It has come again .
I'll meet it if it's the last thing I do .
If you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
Am I a coward ?
Pull off my beard ?
Pinch my nose ?
Call me the worst liar ?
Bloody , inhuman villain !
Remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
Ah , revenge !
What an ass I am .
Damn it !
Murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
If he becomes pale , I know what to do .
I need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
The play's the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
And you can't put your heads together and figure out why he's acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
Did he treat you well when you saw him ?
Yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
He didn't ask questions , but answered ours at length .
Madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
They are here at court now , and I believe they've been told to give a performance for him tonight .
It's true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
It makes me very happy to hear he's so interested .
Gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
We will , my lord .
Yes , I'll go .
I hope so too , Madam .
Ophelia , come here. , I hear him coming .
Quick , let's hide , my lord .
Dying , sleeping , that's all dying is , a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us , that's an achievement to wish for .
To die , to sleep , to sleep , maybe to dream .
That's the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
After all , who would put up with all life's humiliations , the abuse from superiors , the insults of arrogant men , the pangs of unrequited love , the inefficiency of the legal system , the rudeness of people in office , and the mistreatment good people have to take from bad , when you could simply take out your knife and call it quits ?
Who would choose to grunt and sweat through an exhausting life , unless they were afraid of something dreadful after death , the undiscovered country from which no visitor returns , which we wonder about without getting any answers from and which makes us stick to the evils we know rather than rush off to seek the ones we don't ?
But Hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
Very well , thank you .
Well , well , well .
My lord , I have some mementos of yours that I've been meaning to give back to you for a long time now .
Please take them .
There , my lord .
Ha ha , are you good ?
Excuse me ?
Are you beautiful ?
My lord , what are you talking about ?
I'm just saying that if you're good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
But could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
Sure , since beauty's power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin .
This used to be a great puzzle , but now I've solved it .
I used to love you .
You certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
I didn't love you .
Then I guess I was misled .
Get yourself to a
I am arrogant , vengeful , ambitious , with more ill will in me than I can fit into my thoughts , and more than I have time to carry it out in .
Why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
Every one of us is a criminal .
Don't believe any of us .
Hurry to a convent .
Where's your father ?
He's at home , my lord .
Lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
Good-bye .
Oh , dear God , please help him !
Get yourself to a convent , at once .
Good-bye .
Good-bye .
Dear God , please make him normal again !
I've heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
God gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
You dance and prance and lisp ; you call God's creations by pet names , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .
Come on , I won't stand for it anymore .
It's driven me crazy .
I hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
Whoever is already married ( except one person I know ) will stay married , all but one person .
Everyone else will have to stay single .
Get yourself to a convent , fast .
Love ?
His feelings don't move in that direction .
With any luck , the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .
What do you think of this plan ?
It should work .
But I still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love. , Hello , Ophelia .
You don't have to tell us what Lord Hamlet said .
I'll hide and listen in .
If she can't find out what his secret is , then send him off to England or wherever you think best .
That's how we'll do it , then .
If there's any good deed I can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me .
Or if you've got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it .
Stay and speak !
Keep it from leaving , Marcellus .
Should I strike it with my spear ?
Yes , if it doesn't stand still .
It's over here .
There it is .
It's gone .
It was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
Perform the speech just as I taught you , musically and smoothly .
I hate it when I hear a blustery actor in a wig tear a passion to shreds , bursting everyone's eardrums so as to impress the audience on the lower levels of the playhouse , who for the most part can only appreciate loud noises and pantomime shows .
I would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
Please avoid doing that .
I will , sir .
But don't be too tame , either , let your good sense guide you .
I hope we've corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
Oh , correct it completely .
Make sure that the clowns do not ad-lib , since some of them will make certain dumb audience members laugh mindlessly at them , while an important issue in the play needs to be addressed .
Yes , he will , and the queen as well .
Tell the actors to hurry .
Will you two help them get ready ?
Yes , my lord .
Well , hello there , Horatio !
Here I am at your service , my dear lord .
Horatio , you're the best man I've ever known .
Oh , sir , Don't think I'm flattering you .
What could I hope to get from you , who've got nothing but your charm to support you in life ?
Why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
No , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
You understand ?
Ever since I've been a free agent in my choice of friends , I've chosen you because you take everything life hands you with calm acceptance , grateful for both good and bad .
Watch him closely .
They're coming .
I can't talk now .
Take your seat .
So how's my nephew Hamlet doing ?
Wonderful !
I eat the air , like chameleons do .
I'm positively stuffed with air , I eat so much of it .
I have no idea what you're talking about , Hamlet .
You're not answering my question .
Mine , neither .
Indeed I did , my lord .
What role did you play ?
I played Julius Caesar .
I was killed in the Capitol .
Brutus killed me .
Yes , my lord .
They're ready whenever you are .
No thanks , my good mother .
There's a nicer piece of work right here .
My lady , should I lie in your lap ?
No , my lord .
I mean , with my head in your lap ?
Yes , my lord .
Did you think I was talking about sex ?
What is , my lord ?
Nothing .
You're in a good mood tonight , my lord .
Who , me ?
Yes , my lord .
Oh God , who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
What can you do but be happy ?
Look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
No , my lord , it's been four months .
As long as that ?
I'll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
In that case , there's reason to hope a man's memory may outlive him by six months .
But he's got to build churches for that to happen , my lady , or else he'll have to put up with being forgotten , like the hobby-horse in the popular song that goes , "Heigh-ho , heigh-ho , the hobby-horse is forgotten." What does this mean , my lord ?
This means we're having some mischievous fun .
This pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
This guy will tell us everything .
Actors can't keep a secret .
They'll tell all .
Will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
Sure , or anything else you show him .
As long as you aren't ashamed to show it , he won't be ashamed to tell you what it means .
You're naughty .
I'm watching the play .
Was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
It was a bit short , my lord .
Yes , as short as a woman's love .
Madam , how are you liking this play ?
The lady's overdoing it , I think .
Oh , but she'll keep her word .
Is there anything offensive in it ?
Not offensive at all .
What's the play called ?
Yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
Don't you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
I could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me .
We're all waiting for the revenge !
The original story was written in the finest Italian .
You'll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of Gonzago's wife .
The king is getting up .
What , is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
My lord , how are you feeling ?
Get me out of here !
Lights , lights , get us some lights !
No , a whole share for me .
Did you notice ?
Yes , I did , my lord .
When the actors were talking about poison ?
I watched him very closely .
Ah ha !
Hey , let's have some music here !
Play your flutes !
Come on , music !
My lord , could I have a word with you ?
You can have a whole story , not just a word .
Sir , the king , Yes , what about him ?
He's in his chambers now , and he's extremely upset .
I'll be good , sir .
Go ahead .
The queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
It's lovely to see you .
No , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
If you could please stop fooling around , I'll tell you what your mother wants .
If not , I'll leave you alone and that'll be the end of my business .
Sir , I can't .
Can't what , my lord ?
Stop fooling around .
My mind is confused .
Okay , to the point .
Oh , what a wonderful son , I can impress my mother !
But what's the upshot of her admiration ?
Do tell .
She wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
I'd obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
Is there anything else I can do for you ?
My lord , you used to like me .
And still do , I swear by my hands .
My lord , what's wrong with you ?
Sir , I have no future ahead of me .
But how can you say that , when the king himself says you're the heir to the Danish throne ?
I don't really understand what you mean .
Will you play this recorder ?
I can't , my lord .
Please .
I'm serious , I can't .
I'm begging you .
I have no idea how .
Oh , it's as easy as lying .
But I can't play a melody .
I don't know how .
My God , do you think I'm easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
You can push my buttons , but you can't play me for a fool .
Hello and God bless you , sir .
My lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
Do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
By God , it does look like a camel .
To me it looks like a weasel .
It does have a back like a weasel's .
Or like a whale .
Yes , very much like a whale .
I'll go see my mother soon .
I'll tell her .
This is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
I could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
I'll speak as sharp as a dagger to her , but I won't use one on her .
And so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
I don't like the way he's acting , and it's not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control .
So get prepared .
I'm sending you to England on diplomatic business , and Hamlet will go with you .
As king , I can not risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
We'll take care of it .
When a great leader dies he doesn't die alone but , like a whirlpool , draws others with him .
He's like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things , when it falls down the mountain , every little object goes down with it .
Whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
Prepare yourself , please , for this trip .
We'll put a leash on this danger that's now running wild .
We'll hurry .
My lord , Hamlet's going to his mother's room .
I'll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
I bet she'll chew him out .
And as you said ( and you said it wisely ) , it's good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them , since she can be too partial to him .
Goodbye , my lord .
I'll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what I've heard .
Thanks , my dear lord .
It has the mark of
So much for Fortinbras .
That won't work , since I'm still reaping the rewards of that murder : my crown and my queen .
Can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
In this wicked world , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law , shoving justice aside .
But not in heaven .
What is there left to do ?
But it can't help either !
My heart's as black as death .
My soul is stuck to sin , and the more it struggles to break free , the more it sticks .
Help me , angels !
C'mon , make an effort .
I could do it easily now .
He's praying now .
And now I'll do it .
He'll come right away .
I'll be right here , silent .
Have you forgotten who I am ?
No , sit down .
What are you going to do ?
You won't kill me , will you ?
Repent and avoid damnation .
Good night to you .
Who would do that ?
What is it , Laertes ?
What would you like , Laertes ?
Please , let me go .
I have to go to England , don't you know that ?
What , Gertrude ?
How is Hamlet ?
Oh , this is terrible !
His wildness is a threat to all of us , to you , to me , to everyone .
I've gotten it dirty , ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
Believe what ?
Besides , you're a sponge !
You think I'm a sponge , my lord ?
I'm glad about that .
A thing of no importance .
How dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
But a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
But where is he ?
Bring him to me .
At dinner .
What do you mean by that ?
Where is Polonius ?
In heaven .
So get ready to leave .
Good .
Don't waste any time .
I'll tell him , my lord .
Go ahead , then .
Is he attacking the heartland of Poland or some frontier ?
In the end I grudgingly consented .
I hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
So why does it seem so particular to you ?
So then the Poles won't be willing to defend it .
Good-bye , sir .
Start without me .
My God !
I have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
I won't speak to her .
She's insistent .
In fact , she's crazed .
What does she want ?
Show her in .
Please just listen .
Oh , ho !
May God be at your table .
Come , driver !
Good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
Follow her .
Listen !
What is it ?
Where's this so-called king ?
Please wait .
Thank you .
Let him go , Gertrude .
Where's my father ?
He's dead .
Don't mess with me .
Only my free will , nothing else .
Do you want to know who they are , then ?
What's that noise ?
Please remember , love .
It's not manly .
And you're right to do so .
Please , come with me .
Who are the people who want to speak with me ?
Sailors , sir .
They say they have letters for you .
Show them in .
Hello , sir .
God bless you .
May He bless you , too .
He will , sir , if He wants to .
I have a lot to tell you about them .
Good-bye .
It looks that way .
I didn't see them .
Laertes , I want you to hear what they say .
What does this mean ?
Do you recognize the handwriting ?
Naked , " he says .
And in a P.S .
But let him come .
That'll be fine .
All your talents and gifts didn't arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did , though to me it's far from your best attribute .
What quality is that , my lord ?
Yes , from Normandy .
Yes , that's the one .
I know him well .
He's his homeland's jewel .
How could you ask ?
That's the right answer , it shows your love .
Let's go .
Damn it !
But wait , what's that sound ?
Drowned ?
So she is drowned .
Let's follow him , Gertrude .
Let's follow him .
Here's the water , right ?
Is that how the law sees it ?
It sure is .
The coroner's inquest law .
Do you want to know the truth ?
Well there , now you've said it .
Come on , shovel .
They keep up Adam's profession .
What , aren't you a Christian ?
I'll ask you another question .
If you can't answer it , Go ahead !
But how ?
Ah , I've got it !
Go ahead .
Now go and get me some booze .
Yes , exactly .
Indeed , my lord .
Exactly .
There's another .
Could that be a lawyer's skull ?
No more than that , my lord .
Yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
It's mine , sir .
For no man , sir .
How literal this guy is !
You don't know that ?
He'll recover his sanity there .
Why not ?
What do you mean , "in a strange way" ?
On what grounds ?
How long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
A leathermaker will last nine years .
Whose was it ?
A crazy bastard .
Who do you think ?
I really don't know .
Damn that crazy madman !
This one ?
Yes , that one .
Are you sad about that ?
Horatio , tell me something .
Oh God , do I have to remember that ?
She would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she couldn't get enough of him .
Less than a month after my father's death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried .
That's not good , and no good can come of it either .
Hello , sir .
Nice to see you again , Horatio , that is your name , right ?
That's me , sir .
I'll change that name for you .
Hello , sir .
What's that , my lord ?
Do you think Alexander the Great looked like this when he was buried ?
Exactly like that .
And smelled like that , too ?
Whew !
Just as bad , my lord .
How low we can fall , Horatio .
Isn't it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of Alexander the Great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?
If you thought that you'd be thinking too much .
No , not at all .
The great emperor Caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .
Oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
But quiet , be quiet a minute .
Here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
Who are they following ?
Let's stay and watch a while .
What other rites are you going to give her ?
She deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
But she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her .
Isn't there any other rite you can perform ?
No , nothing .
We would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them .
Lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
I'm telling you , you jerk priest , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you're howling in hell .
Sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
Goodbye !
Oh , damn three times , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind .
Hold off burying her until I've caught her in my arms once more .
That's no way to pray .
Pull them apart .
Oh , my son , what issue is that ?
I loved Ophelia .
Forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn't match mine .
What are you going to do for her ?
Oh , he's crazy , Laertes !
For the love of God , be patient with him .
Damn it , show me what you're going to do for her .
Will you cry ?
Fight ?
Stop eating ?
Cut yourself ?
I'll do all that .
And if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
This is pure insanity .
He'll be like this for a little while .
Then he'll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
I always loved you .
But it doesn't matter .
Please , Horatio , go with him .
Who's there ?
No , who are Long live the king !
Is that Barnardo ?
Yes , it's me .
You've come right on time .
The clock's just striking twelve .
Go home to bed , Francisco .
Thanks for letting me go .
It's bitterly cold out , and I'm depressed .
Has it been a quiet night ?
I haven't even heard a mouse squeak .
Well , good night .
If you happen to see Horatio and Marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
I think I hear them .
That's enough about that .
Now I'll tell you the other story about my journey .
Do you remember the circumstances ?
How could I forget , my lord !
There was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn't let me sleep .
It was worse than being a captive in chains .
Is it possible ?
Yes , please tell me .
Do you want to know what I wrote ?
Yes , my lord .
I had my father's signet ring in my pocket , with the royal seal of Denmark on it .
I folded up the new document , signed it , sealed it , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference .
The next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
So Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in for it .
Man , they were asking for it .
I don't feel guilty about them at all .
They got what they deserved .
It's always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
What a king Claudius is !
Isn't it completely moral to kill him now with this sword , and an easy conscience ?
And wouldn't I be damned if I let this monster live to do more harm ?
He'll find out soon what happened in England .
Soon enough .
But I have the meantime .
I'll be nice to him .
It was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
Hang on a minute , who are you ?
Welcome back to Denmark , my lord .
Thank you kindly , sir .
My lord , if you have a free moment , I have a message from His Majesty .
No thank you , my lord .
It's very hot .
It is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
And yet I feel it's very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
Yes indeed it is , sir .
Very humid , I can't tell you how humid it is .
My lord , His Majesty wanted me to tell you that he's placed a large bet on you .
This is what it's all about , Please , I beg you , No , my lord , I'm comfortable like this , thank you .
Sir , your description of him doesn't detract from his good qualities , though I know that trying to list them all would make your head spin , and even so you wouldn't be able to keep up with him .
I felt like skipping school , sir .
I wouldn't allow your enemies to say that , and I won't believe it from you .
I know you'd never skip school .
What are you doing here in Elsinore ?
I'll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
Sir , we came to see your father's funeral .
Please , don't make fun of me .
I think you came to see my mother's wedding instead .
Well , sir , it's true it came soon after .
The leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
Oh , I'd rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , Horatio , than have lived through that terrible day !
My father , I think I see my father .
Where , sir ?
In my imagination , Horatio .
I saw him once .
He was an admirable king .
He was a great human being .
He was perfect in everything .
I'll never see the likes of him again .
You speak absolutely correctly , sir .
And what's the point , sir ?
Why are we talking about him like this ?
Sorry , sir ?
I know you know something , Thanks for the compliment , I'm happy you know that .
But in fact it doesn't say much .
I'm sorry , you were saying ?
I know you know something about how excellent Laertes is ,
I can't admit that , since you'd have to compare his excellence to mine .
Excellent in fencing , I mean , sir .
The rapier and the dagger .
Those are only two of his weapons .
But , go on .
The king has bet six Barbary horses , and he has prepared six French rapiers and daggers with all their accessories .
Three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
What do you mean by "carriages" ?
The carriages , sir , are the hangers , where the swords hang .
Carriage" makes it sound like it's pulling around a cannon .
I prefer to call it a "hanger." But anyway .
Six Barbary horses , six French swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages , sounds like a French bet against the Danish .
Why has all this been put on the table ?
The king , sir , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and Laertes , he won't beat you by more than three hits .
But what if my answer's no ?
It's my exercise time .
My services are at your command .
Thank you .
It's a good thing he's here to recommend himself .
No one else would .
He used to praise his mother's nipple before he sucked it .
The king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
I'll do whatever the king wants .
If he's ready now , so am I .
Otherwise , I'll do it anytime , as long as I'm able .
The king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
Right on cue .
The queen wants you to chat with Laertes , politely , before you begin your match .
She's full of good advice .
You're going to lose this bet , my lord .
I don't think so .
I've been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to France .
With the handicap they've given me , I think I'll win .
But I have a sinking feeling anyway .
Oh well .
I'll say you're not feeling well .
You'll do no such thing .
I thumb my nose at superstitions .
What's important is to be prepared .
Since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
Let it be .
Come shake hands with Laertes , Hamlet .
I will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so .
Yes , hand me one too .
I'm going to make you look sharp , Laertes .
You're making fun of me .
No , I swear I'm not .
Yes , my lord , quite well .
You've bet on the weaker fencer .
I've seen both of you fence .
But since Laertes is better , we've given him a handicap .
Yes , my lord .
Put the goblets of wine on that table .
If Hamlet makes the first or second hit , or gets back at Laertes by making the third hit , then let my soldiers give him a military salute .
I'll drink to Hamlet's health , and into his goblet I'll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four Danish kings .
Give me the goblets .
Come on , sir .
Come on , my lord .
That was one hit .
No , it wasn't .
Referee !
It was obviously a hit .
Well , let's go on .
Give me a goblet. , Hamlet , this pearl's yours .
Here's to your health .
Give him the goblet .
Set it down awhile .
Let's play .
Another hit .
What do you say ?
You got me , I admit it .
My son will win .
He's flabby and out of breath. , Here , Hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
The queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , Hamlet .
Thank you , madam .
Gertrude , don't drink that .
Excuse me .
I'll drink it if I like .
I'd better not drink now .
I'll drink later .
Come on , let me wipe your face .
I doubt it .
Get ready for the third hit , Laertes .
You're just playing around .
Come on , give me your best shot .
I sense you're treating me like a child .
You think so ?
Come on .
Take this !
Separate them .
They're overdoing it .
No , come on , one more time .
Take care of the queen !
Both fencers are bleeding , how do you feel , my lord ?
How do you feel , Laertes ?
Like a mouse caught in my own trap , Osric .
How's the queen ?
She fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
The drink , the drink !
I've been poisoned .
Oh , what evil !
Lock the door .
We've been betrayed !
Find out who did it !
I'm the one , Hamlet .
Hamlet , you're dead .
No medicine in the world can cure you .
You don't have more than half an hour to live .
The treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
The foul plan backfired on me .
Here I lie and will never get up again .
Your mother's been poisoned .
I can't speak anymore .
The king , the king's to blame .
Then get to work , poison !
Sir , I think I saw him last night .
Saw who ?
The king my father ? !
Just listen carefully while I tell you the amazing thing I saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
For God's sake , let me hear it .
After midnight , for two nights running , these two guards , Marcellus and Barnardo , saw a figure that looked very much like your father , in full armor from head to toe .
It just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff's distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak .
I knew your father .
But where did this happen ?
Treason !
Treason !
Protect me , my friends .
I've only been hurt , not killed .
Here , you goddamn incest-breeding Danish murderer , drink this .
Is your little pearl in there ?
Follow my mother .
He got what he deserved .
He mixed that poison himself .
Please forgive me as I forgive you , Hamlet .
You're not responsible for my death and my father's , and I'm not responsible for yours .
God will free you from blame .
You're alive .
Not for a second .
I'm more like an ancient Roman than a corrupt modern Dane .
Some of this liquor's still left in the goblet .
Please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
Let go of it !
I'll get it from you , I swear .
Oh God , Horatio , what a damaged reputation I'm leaving behind me , as no one knows the truth .
If you ever loved me , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story .
What are these warlike noises ?
Young Fortinbras , returning in triumph from Poland , is firing his guns to greet the English ambassadors .
Oh , I'm dying , Horatio !
This strong poison's overpowering me .
I will not live to hear the news from England .
But I bet Fortinbras will win the election to the Danish crown .
He's got my vote as I die .
Oh , oh , oh , oh .
What do I see here ?
What would you like to see ?
These corpses suggest mayhem .
Oh , proud Death , what banquet are you preparing that you've needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke ?
This is a horrible sight .
We meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead .
Who will thank us now ?
As for me , I welcome my good luck with sadness .
Let four captains carry Hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
Military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
Pick up the corpses .
On the platform where we stand guard , sir .
Didn't you talk to it ?
I did , sir , but it didn't answer me .
That's very strange .
I swear to God it's true , sir .
We thought you ought to know about it .
Yes , I should know , but it disturbs me .
Are you on duty again tonight ?
Yes , sir .
It was armed , you say ?
Armed , sir .
From head to toe ?
Yes , from top to bottom , sir .
So you couldn't see his face , then ?
Oh , yes , we could , sir .
He had his helmet visor up .
Was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
Very pale , sir .
Did he stare at you ?
The whole time .
I wish I'd been there .
Did it stay a long time ?
About as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
No , longer than that .
Not the time I saw it .
His beard was gray , right ?
It was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
I'll stand guard with you tonight .
Maybe it'll come again .
I bet it will .
If it looks like my good father , I'll speak to it , even if Hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet .
I ask you , if you've kept this a secret , keep doing so .
Whatever happens tonight , don't talk about it .
I'll return the favor .
So good-bye for now .
I'll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
We'll do our duty to you , sir .
Give me your love instead , as I give you mine .
Good-bye .
My father's ghost , armed !
Something's wrong .
I suspect some foul play .
I wish the night were here already !
Until then , I have to remain calm .
Bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
My belongings are on the ship already .
Good-bye .
And , my dear sister , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing , let me hear from you , write .
Do you doubt I'll write ?
As for Hamlet and his attentions to you , just consider it a big flirtation , the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth .
It won't last .
Not a second more .
No more than a minute ?
Then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands .
Watch out , Ophelia .
Just keep your love under control , and don't let yourself become a target of his lust .
Baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
So be careful .
Fear will keep you safe .
Young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
I'll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
Don't worry , I won't .
I've been here too long .
And here comes father .
You're still here ?
Shame on you , get on board !
The wind is filling your ship's sail , and they're waiting for you .
Here , I give you my blessing again .
And just try to remember a few rules of life .
Don't say what you're thinking , and don't be too quick to act on what you think .
Be friendly to people but don't overdo it .
Don't be quick to pick a fight , but once you're in one , hold your own .
Listen to many people , but talk to few .
Hear everyone's opinion , but reserve your judgment .
Good-bye , son .
Your servants are waiting .
It's locked away in my memory , and you've got the key .
Good-bye .
What did he tell you , Ophelia ?
Something about Hamlet .
If things are the way people tell me they are , and they're only telling me this to warn me , then I have to say , you're not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show .
What's going on between you two ?
Tell me the truth .
He's offered me a lot of affection lately .
Affection ! " That's nothing !
You're talking like some innocent girl who doesn't understand the ways of the world .
Do you believe his "offers , " as you call them ?
I don't know what to believe , father .
Then I'll tell you .
Believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these "offers" are something real .
Offer yourself more respect , or , not to beat this word to death , you'll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock .
Go on .
And he's made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
These vows are just traps for stupid birds .
I know when a man is on fire , he'll swear anything .
Remember that Hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
Do as I say .
Now come along .
I'll do as you say , father .
Friends of this country .
And servants of the Danish king .
Good night to you both .
Good-bye .
Who's taken over the watch for you ?
Barnardo's taken my place .
Good night .
Is Horatio here too ?
More or less .
So , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
I haven't seen anything .
Horatio says we're imagining it , and won't let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we've seen twice now .
That's why I've begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
Yes , it's definitely nippy .
What time is it ?
A little before twelve , I think .
No , it's just after twelve ; I heard the clock strike .
Really ?
I didn't hear it .
So it's nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
What does that mean , sir ?
Is that a tradition ?
Yes , it is .
But though I was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage , I think it would be better to ignore it than practice it .
Other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
They call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
And our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
A tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
Look , sir , here it comes !
Oh angels , protect us !
Whether you're a good spirit or a cursed demon , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire , whether your intentions are good or evil , you look so strange I want to talk to you .
I'll call you "Hamlet Senior , " "King , " "Father , " "royal Dane." Answer me !
Don't drive me crazy with curiosity , but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin , and why your tomb ,
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
Why ?
It wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
Look how politely it's pointing you to a place that's farther away .
But don't go .
Definitely not .
Don't do it , sir .
Why , what's the danger ?
And as for my soul , how can the ghost endanger that , since it's as immortal as the ghost is ?
Look , it's waving me over again .
I'll follow it .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
Think about it .
It's still waving to me .
You're not going , sir .
Let go of me .
Calm down .
You're not going anywhere .
Let me go , gentlemen .
I swear , if anyone holds me back , I'll make a ghost of him !
His imagination is making him crazy .
Let's follow them .
It's not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
No , let's follow him .
Where are you taking me ?
Speak .
Listen to me .
I will .
The hour has almost come when I have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
Ah , poor ghost !
Speak .
I'm ready to hear you .
You must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
What ?
I'm the ghost of your father , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night , while during the day I'm trapped in the fires of purgatory until I've done penance for my past sins .
If I weren't forbidden to tell you the secrets of
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
But mortals like you aren't allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
Listen , listen !
If you ever loved your poor dear father , Oh God !
Take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
Murder ?
His most horrible murder .
Murder's always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
You'd have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of I knew it !
My uncle ?
Oh , Hamlet , how far she fell !
She went from me , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine .
So let me be brief here .
And that's how my brother robbed me of my life , my crown , and my queen all at once .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible , so horrible !
If you are human , don't stand for it .
Don't let the Danish king's bed be a nest of incest .
Leave her to God and her own guilt .
Now , good-bye .
The glowworm's light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
Good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
Remember me .
Ah , all you up in heaven !
And earth !
What else ?
Shall I include hell as well ?
Damn it !
Keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don't grow old yet , keep me standing .
Remember you !
Yes , you poor ghost , as long as I have any power of memory in this distracted head .
Remember you !
Yes , I'll wipe my mind clean of all trivial facts and memories and preserve only your commandment there .
Yes , by God !
Oh , you evil woman !
Oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
Where's my notebook ? , It's a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile , and be a villain .
At least it's possible in Denmark .
He said , "Remember me." I swore I would .
Sir , sir !
Lord Hamlet. , Please let him be all right !
I'm all right .
Oh-ho-ho , sir !
Oh-ho-ho , kid !
Come here .
So how did it go , sir ?
What happened , sir ?
It was incredible !
Oh , please , tell us , sir .
I swear I won't , sir .
I won't either , sir .
Okay .
But you promise you can keep a secret ?
Yes , I swear .
Sit down for a while , and we'll tell you again the story you don't want to believe , about what we've seen two nights now .
Well , let's sit down and listen to Barnardo tell us .
Last night , when that star to the west of the North Star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it's shining now , at one o'clock , Marcellus and I , Quiet , shut up !
It's come again .
Looking just like the dead king .
Very much so .
It's terrifying .
It wants us to speak to it .
Ask it something , Horatio .
By God , I order you to speak .
Any villain in Denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
You don't need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
Yes , you're absolutely right .
So , without further ado , the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways .
You go and take care of your business ( since everybody has some business to take care of , whatever it is worth ) , and I'll go and pray .
You're talking in such a crazy way , sir .
No offense taken .
Ah , but there is , Horatio , there's a lot of offense .
As for this ghost we just saw , he's a real one , I can tell you that much .
But regarding what happened between us , don't ask , I can't tell you .
And now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
What is it , sir ?
Of course we will .
Don't ever tell anyone what you've seen tonight .
We won't , sir .
No , you have to swear it .
I swear to God I won't .
Me too , I won't , I swear to God .
Swear by my sword .
But we already swore , sir .
Yes , but swear by my sword this time .
Agree to swear .
You swear never to mention what you've seen .
Swear by my sword .
Come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
Swear by my sword you'll never mention what you've heard .
You said it right , old mole .
What a tunneler !
Let's move again , my friends .
My God , this is unbelievably strange .
Then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
There are more things in heaven and earth , Horatio , than you've even dreamed of .
Swear you won't .
Let's go back to court together , but
Give him this money and these letters , Reynaldo .
I will , sir .
It would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear Reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
That's what I thought too , sir .
Excellent , very good .
Do you get what I'm saying , Reynaldo ?
Yes , very well , sir .
You should say , "I sort of know him , but not well .
Isn't he the one who's always , " and so on .
Like gambling , sir ?
That's right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes , that kind of thing .
But that would ruin his reputation !
Oh no , not if you say it right .
But , sir , Why should you do this , you want to know ?
Yes , sir .
I'd like to know .
Yes , sir .
And then he'll , he'll , wait , what was I about to say ?
Good God , I was about to say something .
What was I saying ?
I just saw him yesterday , " or "the other day , " or whenever it is , you know , "and there he was gambling , " or "there he was , totally wasted , or fighting with somebody about a tennis match , or going into a house of ill repute" , that means a whorehouse , you know , or whatever .
You get my point , don't you ?
Yes , I do , sir .
God bless you .
Have a safe trip .
Thank you , sir .
I will , sir .
And I hope he's studying his music like he's supposed to .
Got it , sir .
Good-bye .
From what , in God's name ?
Is he crazy with love for you ?
What did he say ?
He stayed like that a long time .
Finally , after shaking my arm a little , and jerking his head up and down three times , he sighed like it was his last breath .
Come with me .
I'll go tell the king about this .
Love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
I'm so sorry .
That's what made him crazy .
I regret not observing him more closely before I told you to do that .
I thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
Damn my suspicious thoughts !
It's as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
Come on , let's go see the king .
Welcome , dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern .
I've wanted to see you for a long time now , but I sent for you so hastily because I need your help right away .
You've probably heard about the "change" that's come over Hamlet , that's the only word for it , since inside and out he's different from what he was before .
I can't imagine what's made him so unlike himself , other than his father's death .
Both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
But we'll obey .
Thanks , Rosencrantz and worthy Guildenstern .
Thanks , Guildenstern and worthy Rosencrantz .
I beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who's changed too much .
Servants , take these gentlemen to see Hamlet .
I hope to God we can make him happy and do him some good !
Amen to that !
The ambassadors are back from Norway , sir .
Once again you bring good news .
Do I , sir ?
I assure your majesty I'm only doing my duty both to my God and my good king .
It looks like you've offended it .
Look , it's going away .
Stay !
I order you , speak !
What's going on , Horatio ?
You're pale and trembling .
You agree now that we're not imagining this , don't you ?
What do you think about it ?
I swear to God , if I hadn't seen this with my own eyes I'd never believe it .
Doesn't it look like the king ?
Yes , as much as you look like yourself .
The king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of Norway .
And the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the Poles , traveling on the ice in sleds .
It's weird .
And I believe , unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be , that I've found out why Hamlet's gone crazy .
Tell me !
I want very much to find out .
All right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
Then you can hear my news , as dessert .
Then be so kind as to show them in .
Gertrude , he says he's found out the reason for your son's insanity .
I doubt it's anything but the obvious reason : his father's dying and our quick marriage .
Welcome , my good friends .
Tell me , Voltemand , what's the news from the king of Norway ?
He was very upset that Fortinbras had taken advantage of his being old and sick to deceive him , and he ordered Fortinbras's arrest .
Fortinbras swore never to threaten Denmark again .
The old king was so overjoyed by this promise that he gave young Fortinbras an annual income of three thousand I like this news , and when I have time I'll read this and think about how to reply .
Meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
Go relax now .
Tonight we'll have dinner .
Welcome back !
Well , that turned out well in the end .
Sir and madam , to make grand speeches about what majesty is , what service is , or why day is day , night is night , and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day , night , and time .
Your son is crazy .
Crazy" I'm calling it , since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it's craziness ?
But that's another story .
Think about it .
I have a daughter ( I have her until she gets married ) who's given me this letter , considering it her duty .
Madam , please be patient .
I'll read it to you .
Oh , Ophelia , I'm bad at poetry .
I can't put my feelings into verse , but please believe I love you best , oh , best of all .
Believe it .
Hamlet." Dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
And how did she react to all this ?
Sir , what is your opinion of me ?
I know you are loyal and honorable .
I would like to prove to you that I am .
No , I had to do something .
And so I said to my daughter : "Lord Hamlet is a prince , he's out of your league .
It may be , it certainly may be .
Has there ever been a time , I'd really like to know , when I've definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
Not that I know of .
What can we do to find out if it's true ?
Well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
Yes , he does .
When he's there next time , I'll send my daughter to see him .
Please go away , both of you .
I'll speak to him now .
Oh , please let me .
How are you , Hamlet ?
Fine , thank you .
Do you know who I am ?
The town is besieged , and the trumpet calls us to the gap , and we talk and do nothing , by Christ .
It's a disgrace to us all .
I swear by the mass , before I close my eyes to go to sleep , I'll put in some good fighting , or I'll lie in the ground dead .
Captain Macmorris , I think , see , correct me if I'm wrong , there are not many of your nation , My nation ?
What is my nation ?
It's a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
What is my nation ?
Who talks of my nation ?
Captain Macmorris , if you take my words in some way other than how they were meant , see , I'll have to think you're not treating me with the good will you ought to , see , since I am as good a man as yourself , both in the practice of war and in my country of origin and in other respects .
I do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
So , by Christ , I'll cut off your head .
Now , now , both of you gentlemen !
Yes , and that's a serious failing .
The town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
Captain Macmorris , when we have more leisure , see , I will be so bold as to show you I know about the practice of warfare , and that's that .
What has the governor of the town decided ?
This is the final discussion I will grant .
So submit to my mercy or , like men who revel in their own destruction , challenge me to do my worst .
For , as I am a soldier , the name I think suits me best , once I begin my attack on Harfleur again , I will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .
The gates of mercy will be closed by then , and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers , who have tasted blood , will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want , mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants .
What power can rein in promiscuous evil once it's gotten rolling ?
We might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting .
What do you say ?
Will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
Today our hopes are at an end .
The Dauphin , whom we asked for reinforcements , sends back the answer that he's not yet in a position to raise so great an army .
Therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
Open your gates .
Come , uncle Exeter , enter Harfleur .
Stay there and fortify it well against the French .
Tonight in Harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we'll march on .
No , I'll recite it for you right now : "de hand , de fangres , de nails , " "De nails , " madame .
Ugh !
That's enough for one lesson .
He's certainly crossed the river Somme .
And if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon France .
Let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
God alive !
If they march along unopposed , I will sell my dukedom for a sodden , filthy farm in that craggy isle of Albion .
Doesn't the sun shine palely down on them , as though in contempt , killing their fruit with frowns ?
And shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
Where is Montjoy , the herald ?
Send him on his way quickly .
Tell him to greet the king of England with our sharp defiance .
Rise , princes , and , with a spirit of honor more sharply edged than your swords , rush to the battlefield : Charles Delabreth , High Constable of France ; you dukes of Orleans , Bourbon , Berri , Alencon , Brabant , Bar , and Burgundy ; Jaques Chatillon , Rambures , Vaudemont , Beaumont , Grandpre , Roussi , and Fauconberg , Foix , Lestrale , Bouciqualt , and Charolois .
Stop Harry of England , who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the French blood he spilled at Harfleur .
Have Montjoy hurry , then , Lord Constable , and have him ask the king of England what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war .
Prince Dauphin , you'll stay with me in Rouen .
No , please , I beg your Majesty .
Be patient , because you're staying with me .
Go now , Lord Constable and all you princes , and quickly bring us news of England's defeat .
Is the duke of Exeter safe ?
He is called Ensign Pistol .
I don't know him .
Here he is .
Captain , I have a favor to beg of you .
You're on very good terms with the duke of Exeter .
Yes , God be praised , I have managed to earn his favor .
She provides an excellent moral .
I'm glad to hear it .
Discipline must be kept .
Then die and be damned !
Why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
What he just said to me , it's alright .
And what a beard trimmed like the general's or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale , you wouldn't believe .
But you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
If I find an opportunity , I will give him a piece of my mind .
Tell me , Fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
Yes , your Majesty .
The duke of Exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
The French have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
Indeed , the enemy nearly took the bridge , but he was forced to retreat , and the duke of Exeter holds the bridge .
I can tell your Majesty , the duke is a brave man .
What men have you lost , Fluellen ?
The enemy's losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
To tell the truth , though , I think the duke hasn't lost a single man , except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church , one Bardolph , I don't know if your Majesty knows the man .
I want all such offenders to be dealt with that way , and I give precise orders that in our progress through the country there shall be nothing seized from the villages , nothing taken that is not paid for , none of the French harassed or abused in disrespectful language .
You know from my clothing who I am .
Well then , I know who you are .
What do you have to tell me ?
My master's decision .
Go ahead .
My king says this : "Tell Harry of England : though we appeared dead , we were only asleep .
Strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
Tell him we could have driven him back at Harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
Now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
Favorably , except that there wasn't enough time for his Grace to hear , as I sensed he would have liked to , the details about how he is rightfully entitled to certain dukedoms in France , and to the throne of France in general , through clear lines of descent originating with his great-grandfather , Edward III .
What kept you from telling him this ?
The French ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
And , in fact , I think they're meeting together right now .
Is it four o'clock ?
It is .
Then let's go in and hear what he has to say , though I think I can guess before the Frenchman has uttered a word .
have lost , and the indignity we have endured , for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back .
His coffers are too poor to atone for our losses , his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we've shed , and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with .
Add defiance to all this and , by way of conclusion , tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him , whose death sentence has been pronounced." My king and master's message delivered , my task is done .
What is your name ?
I know your position .
Montjoy .
You do your job well .
Go back and tell your king I do not seek an encounter with him now but would be willing to march on to Calais without interference , for , to be honest , though it's probably unwise to confess this to a powerful enemy who has the advantage , my men are considerably weakened by illness , my numbers reduced , and those few men I have almost no better than so many Frenchmen , though when they were in good form , I tell you , herald , I thought three Frenchmen walked on every pair of English legs .
But God forgive me for bragging .
Anyway , go tell your master I am here .
I'll deliver the message .
I thank your Highness .
I hope they don't attack us now .
We're in God's hands , brother , not in theirs .
March to the bridge .
Night is approaching .
I have the best armor in the world .
I wish it were day !
You have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
It is the best horse in Europe .
Will it never be morning ?
My lord of Orleans , and my lord high Constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
You are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
What a long night this is !
I will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
He leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
The earth sings when he touches it .
The lowest part of his hoof is more musical than Pan's pipe .
He's the color of nutmeg .
And hot as ginger .
He is an animal worthy of Perseus .
He is indeed worthy of the name "horse , " and you can call all the rest beasts .
Indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
He is the prince of horses .
His neigh is like a monarch's command .
Enough , cousin .
No , the man who can not extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever .
It's a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
If each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize , my horse would be a topic for them all .
He is a subject for a king to contemplate , and for a king's king to ride on , and for the world at large , both friend and stranger , to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at .
I once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began , "Wonder of nature , " I have heard a sonnet to one's mistress that began like that .
Then the writer imitated the one I composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
Your mistress is a good mount .
So , perhaps , did yours .
Mine wasn't wearing a bridle .
Oh , then I guess she was old and gentle , and you rode barelegged , like an Irish yokel .
You're a good judge of horsemanship .
Take a tip from me , then .
I'd rather have my horse than a mistress .
I'd prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
I'll tell you this , Constable , my mistress has his own hair .
I could make the same boast even if I had a pig as my mistress .
The dog returns to its own vomit , and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle." You'd take anything for a mistress .
At least I don't have a horse for my mistress , or a saying so beside the point .
My Lord Constable , are those stars or suns I saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
Stars , my lord .
I hope some will fall off tomorrow .
And yet I'll still have plenty .
No doubt , for you wear too many in the first place , and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer .
Yes , like your horse , who , staggering under your boasts , would trot more easily if some of them dismounted .
I only wish I could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
Oh , will it never be day ?
I'd say the same thing , but I'm afraid I'd be faced out of my way .
It's midnight .
I'll go put my armor on .
The Dauphin really wants it to be morning .
He wants to eat the English .
Swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
He's definitely the most active gentleman of France .
Performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
He never did harm that I heard of .
And he's not going to do any tomorrow .
That part of his reputation will stand .
I know him to be valiant .
I was told that by one who knows him better than you .
Who was that ?
Why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn't care who knew it .
He doesn't have to care .
His virtue is not hidden .
His courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
Ill will never prompted anything well said .
I'll go straight for that proverb with "To hell with the devil." You are better at proverbs than I am by as much as "A fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark." You have overshot .
I've outshot you , and not for the first time .
My Lord High Constable , the English lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
Who measured the ground ?
The Lord Grandpre .
Poor Harry of England !
He doesn't long for the dawn as we do .
What a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of England is , to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity .
If the English had any sense , they would run away .
If there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
That island of England breeds very valiant creatures .
Their hounds are unequaled in courage .
Foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a Russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
You might just as well say , "That's a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion." Yes , exactly .
And the men resemble their English hounds in their loud , showy ferocity , too , leaving their brains behind with their wives .
Give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel , and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
Yes , but these English are seriously short of beef .
Then tomorrow we'll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
It's time to put our armor on .
Shall we get started ?
It's two o'clock now .
But let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred Englishmen .
Now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
He bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
Where is my gracious lord of Canterbury ?
He's not here .
Send for him , dear uncle .
Shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
Not yet , cousin .
Before I hear him , I want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and France .
May God and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
Thank you , I'm sure .
My learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this French Salic law either should or shouldn't bar me in my claim .
For God knows how many healthy men will shed their blood in support of whatever you persuade me to do .
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
There is no indication of the mighty army that surrounds them in his expression , nor has the long , sleepless night robbed his face of an ounce of color .
Gloucester , it's true that we are in great danger .
But our courage should only be the greater for that .
Good morning , brother Bedford .
God Almighty , there must be some essential goodness even in evil , if men would only look for it .
In our case , our bad neighbors over their make us early risers , a healthy and sensible thing to be .
Besides , they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all , a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death .
Think like that , and you'll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself .
Good morning , old Sir Thomas Erpingham !
A nice , soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than France's hard , cold ground .
It eases the spirit .
And when the mind is engaged , the rest of the body , dead and dull before , wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity , like a snake shedding its dead skin .
Lend me your cloak , Sir Thomas .
We shall , my liege .
Shall I accompany your Grace ?
No , my good knight .
Go with my brothers to my English peers .
I need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don't want any company .
The Lord in heaven bless you , noble Harry !
A friend .
Or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
I am a gentleman of a company .
Do you carry a pike ?
Exactly .
What about you ?
I'm as good a gentleman as the emperor .
Then you're a better man than the king .
The king's a dear boy with a heart of gold , he's a lively lad , a wag , born of fine parents , good with his fists .
I kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart I love the lovely boy .
What is your name ?
Harry le Roy .
Le Roy ?
That's a Cornish name .
Are you with a Cornish company ?
No , I am a Welshman .
Do you know Fluellen ?
Yes .
Tell him I'll take the leek out of his hat on Saint Davy's Day and slap his head with it .
You'd better not wear your dagger in your cap that day , or he might slap your head with it .
Are you his friend ?
Yes , and his relative , too .
Thank you .
God be with you .
My name is Pistol .
The name suits your fierceness .
Captain Fluellen !
It never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
If you would take the trouble to study the tactics of Pompey the Great , I can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in Pompey's camp .
I tell you , you would find the rituals of war and , I promise you , its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise .
But the enemy is loud .
You can hear them all night long .
And if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot , does that mean , you think , that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot ?
Think about it .
I will lower my voice .
Though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this Welshman .
Brother John Bates , isn't that dawn breaking over there ?
That's the beginning of the day we see , but I don't think we'll see the end of it. , Who goes there ?
A friend .
What captain do you serve ?
Sir Thomas Erpingham .
A veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
Tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
We're men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
He hasn't told this to the king , has he ?
The violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
And though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours , when they plummet , they plummet that much farther .
Therefore , when he has reason to fear , as we do , his fears are without question of the same order .
Still , it stands to reason that he mustn't betray his fear , as it might dishearten his army .
He can act as brave as he wants , but I believe on a cold night like this he wishes he were neck-deep in the Thames , and I wish he were , too , and I with him , whatever the danger , so long as we were far away from here .
I'll tell you truly what I think about the king in my heart .
I don't think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
Oh , I'm sure you don't dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone , even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel .
I don't think there's anywhere I'd rather die than in the king's company , as his cause is just and honorable .
That's more than we know .
If his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
But if the cause is not just , the king himself will have a lot to answer for , when all those legs and arms and heads chopped off in battle shall join together on Judgment Day crying , "We died at such and such a place." Some will be swearing , some crying for a surgeon , some for the wives that are destitute without them , some about the debts they owed , some for their children left unprovided for .
I think few die well who die in battle .
The father and the master and the king didn't order their subordinates ' deaths when they ordered their services .
Besides , there's no king , however pure his cause , who , if it comes to a trial by combat , can rely on using completely blameless soldiers .
Even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they can not escape God .
When they feared death , they escaped with their lives ; and now where they imagine they're safe , they perish .
So , if they die unprepared , the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they're finally being punished for .
Every subject's duty is the king's , but every subject's soul is his own .
Therefore , every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do : clear his conscience of any stain .
Then if he dies , his death serves him .
It's clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
The king is not responsible for it .
I don't expect him to answer for me , and yet I'm determined to fight vigorously for him .
I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
If I live to see it , I'll never trust his word again .
Yeah , right , go get him .
That's a lame threat from a toy gun , a poor individual's private displeasure with a monarch .
You may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
You'll "never trust his word again." Come on , that was a stupid thing to say .
Your scolding is somewhat overblown .
I'd be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
Let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
I'm game .
How will I recognize you in the future ?
Give me some trinket of yours , and I will wear it in my hat .
Then , if you dare to acknowledge it , I'll take up my quarrel with you .
Here .
I'll also wear this in my cap .
If you come to me after tomorrow and say , "That's my glove , " I swear by this hand , I will take it and give you a box on the ear .
If I ever see it , I will challenge you .
You may as well undertake to be hanged .
I'll do it even if I find you in the company of the king himself .
Keep your word .
Farewell .
Indeed , the French can bet twenty French crowns to one that they'll beat us , they have such an army .
But it's no treason for an Englishman to cut off a French crown , a head , I mean , and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping .
to wage war .
I charge you , in the name of God , be careful what you say .
With this in mind , speak , my lord .
Then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
Upon the king !
Let's lay everything upon the king : our lives , our souls , our debts , our anxious wives , our children , and our sins." I must bear responsibility for all of it .
What a painful condition responsibility is .
It goes along with being born to greatness , but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about .
What infinite peace do king's give up that private men enjoy ?
What do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
And what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
What kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
What income , what profit does it bring in ?
Oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
Why are you adored ?
You're less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
What do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
Try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
Do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
Will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
You can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
No , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king's rest .
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace .
My lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
Good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
I'll meet you there .
Consider it done , my lord .
Oh God of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
Don't let them know fear .
Rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
And just for today , Oh , Lord , just today don't think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown !
I've transferred Richard's body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood .
I've hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven , praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .
And I've built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for Richard's soul .
I will do more , though nothing I can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime , asking for pardon .
My liege .
My brother Gloucester's voice ?
I'll go with you .
The day , my friends , and everything await me .
The sun glints off our armor .
Awake , my lords !
Is it time , my Lord Constable ?
Listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
Ha !
What , you want them to weep our horses ' blood ?
Then how will we see their own natural tears ?
The English are in the field , French lords .
To our horses , you gallant princes .
What's there to say ?
Our advance will so dazzle the enemy that England will cower in fear and surrender .
What are you waiting for , lords of France ?
Those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
The horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
Meanwhile , their They've said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
Shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
To the field !
I'll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
Come , let's be off !
The sun is up and we're wasting the day !
Where is the king ?
The king rode out alone to view their troops .
They have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
That's five to one .
Besides , they're fresh .
May God's arm strike on our side !
These are frightening odds .
God be with all of you , princes .
I'll go and join my men .
Farewell , good Salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
Farewell , kind lord .
Fight valiantly today .
But then I do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
He is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
Oh , if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in England who aren't working today .
Who wishes that ?
My cousin Westmoreland ?
No , my dear cousin .
If we are slated to die , the fewer , the better for our country , and if we're slated to live , the fewer men , the greater the share of honor for each of us .
In God's name , I beg you not to wish for one more man .
By God , I am not selfish when it comes to money : I don't care who eats at my expense .
But if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , I am the most guilty soul alive .
No , my cousin , don't wish that even one man who is now in England were here instead .
By God , I wouldn't lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me , I think , not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .
Oh , do not wish one more !
He will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
We would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
He who survives this day and lives to see old age shall yearly entertain his neighbors on the eve , saying , "Tomorrow is
We're ready if our minds are ready .
Let any man perish who isn't ready now !
You don't wish we had more help from England anymore , cousin ?
God be with you all .
Once more I come to ask you , King Harry , if you're ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat .
For assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you're bound to be swallowed up .
Moreover , out of mercy , the Constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with God and repent , so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where , poor wretches , their bodies will likely fall and fester .
Who sent you this time ?
The Constable of France .
Be good enough to take back the same answer I gave before .
Tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
The man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
And on their graves , I trust , the story of this day's work will be written in brass .
And those who leave their valiant bones in France , dying like men though buried in your dunghills , they'll be remembered , too .
Besides , according to the French historians , King Pepin , who deposed Childeric , based his own claim to the crown of France on his descent from Blithild , the daughter of King Clothair .
Another case : Hugh Capet , who usurped the crown from Charles the duke of Lorraine , sole male heir in a direct line from Charles the Great , passed himself off as heir to Lady Lingare , daughter of Charlemagne , who was the son of Lewis the Emperor ( who was the son of Charles the Great ) , in order to give his claim to the throne more validity ( though , in fact , the claim was completely false and worthless ) .
Another case : King Lewis the Tenth , who was sole heir to the usurper Capet , could not rest easy as king until he was assured that Queen Isabel , his grandmother , was a direct descendent of the Lady Ermengare , daughter of the aforementioned Charles duke of Lorraine , by which marriage the line of Charles the Great was reunited with the throne of France .
Thus , it should be clear as day that King Pepin's title , Hugh Capet's claim , and the resolution of King Lewis's doubts all plainly derive from the female .
Let me speak proudly : tell the Constable we're only workaday soldiers .
There's not a strand of feather left in our whole army , a good sign , I hope , that we won't fly away like birds , and time on the field has made us slovenly .
If they do this , as they will , God willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
Herald , spare yourself .
Don't come again to ask for my ransom , good messenger .
I swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
Tell the constable that .
I shall , King Harry .
And so farewell .
You'll never hear from the herald again .
I'm afraid you'll come to me again for ransom .
My lord , most humbly on bended knee I beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
Take it , brave York .
Now , soldiers , advance .
Surrender , dog !
Is that a lot of He says his name is Master Fer .
Master Fer !
What does he say ?
He begs you to spare his life .
He is a gentleman of a good family , and for his ransom , he will give you two hundred crowns .
Tell him my fury will abate , and I'll take the crowns .
Explain , boy .
He thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one , as he thinks , who is the bravest , most valorous , and thrice-worthy gentleman of England .
As I get to leech him , I will show some mercy .
Follow me .
I never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
I have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp's luggage .
We're sitting ducks for the French , if they only knew it , for there is no one guarding it but boys .
Regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
Do not run away .
Our men have all broken ranks .
O , everlasting shame !
Let's fall on our swords .
Are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
Is this the king we offered to ransom ?
Shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
Let us die honorably .
He who will not follow me now , let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp , cap in hand , while some slave , no nobler than my dog , violates his daughter .
Maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
Let's go offer up our lives
There are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the English with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .
The hell with order !
I'm going back into battle .
Let life be short so that shame won't last too long .
The French are still fighting .
The duke of York sends your Majesty his respects .
Is he still alive , good uncle ?
Three times in an hour I saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
He was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
By his side lies the noble earl of Suffolk , York's comrade and equal in brave wounds .
Suffolk died first , and York , cut to pieces , came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face , kissing his gashes .
He cried out , "Wait for me , dear cousin .
My soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
Wait for mine , sweet soul .
The French have reinforced their scattered men .
Then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
Spread the word .
To this day , the kings of France follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this Salic law to bar your Highness from inheriting it through the female line .
Can I justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
For it is written in the book of Numbers : "When the man dies , let the inheritance descend unto the daughter." Gracious lord , claim what is yours .
Go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
Invoke his warlike spirit and that of Edward the Black Prince , your great-uncle , who fought a tragic battle on French soil , routing the French army in full force while his mighty father stood by on a hilltop , smiling to see his son steeped in the blood of French noblemen .
O noble English , who could take on the entire French army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
Awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
You are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins .
To kill the boys with the luggage !
It's expressly against the rules of combat .
It's as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
There's certainly not a boy left alive , and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle .
On top of this , they've either burned or carried away everything that was in the king's tent .
Oh , he's a gallant king !
Yes , he was born at Monmouth , Captain Gower .
And is "pig" not the same as "great , " may I ask ?
The pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous , they all mean the same thing , with some variation .
I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon .
His father was Philip of Macedon , as I remember .
I think that Macedon is indeed where Alexander was born .
I tell you , Captain , if you look at a map of the world , I'll bet you will find , comparing Macedon and Monmouth , that the situations , see , are very similar .
There is a river in Macedon , and there is likewise a river in Monmouth .
The river in Monmouth is called Wye , but the name of the other river has gone out of my head .
Nevertheless , it's all one , the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers , and there are salmon in both .
If you look closely at Alexander's life , Harry of Monmouth's stands up fairly well by comparison , for there are analogies in everything .
Alexander , God knows and you know , in his rages and his furies and his wraths and his angers and his moods and his displeasures and his indignations , and also being a little the worse for drink , killed his best friend Cleitus in a drunken rage , see .
It is not courteous , you know , to assume you know my meaning before I've finished talking .
I'm speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
Sir John Falstaff .
That's the one .
I tell you , there are good men born at Monmouth .
Here comes his Majesty .
I was not angry since I came to France until this instant .
Take a trumpet , herald .
Ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
If they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
The sight of them is offensive .
If they'll do neither , we'll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
Go and tell them this .
Here comes the herald of the French , my liege .
He looks humbler than he used to .
Don't you know that I have offered these bones of mine for ransom ?
Are you coming again for ransom ?
No , great king .
I come to ask you out of charity to let us wander over this bloody field to record the numbers of our dead and bury them , separating our nobles from the common men , for many of our princes , alas ! , lie drowned and soaked in the blood of mercenary soldiers .
Likewise , our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes , and their wounded steeds , ankle-deep in gore , struggle and , raging wildly , stamp on their dead masters with their hooves , killing them a second time .
Oh , give us permission , great king , to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies .
You won it .
God , not our strength , be praised !
What is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
Agincourt .
Then we'll call this the Battle of Agincourt , fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus .
If I may say so , your Majesty , your famous grandfather and your great-uncle Edward , the Black Prince of Wales , or so I've read in the history books , fought a very brave battle here in France .
They did , Fluellen .
Your Majesty is quite right .
If your Majesties recall it , the Welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing , wearing leeks in their Monmouth caps which , your Majesty knows , is to this day a badge of honorable military service .
I do believe your Majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on Saint Davy's Day .
I wear it with pride , for I am Welsh you know , good countryman .
Thanks , my good countryman .
By Jesus , I am your Majesty's countryman , and I don't care who knows it .
I will confess it to all the world .
I needn't be ashamed of your Majesty , God be praised , so long as your Majesty is an honest man .
God keep me so. , Heralds , go with him .
Bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
Soldier , you must come to the king .
Soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
If it pleases your Majesty , it is the token of a man I must fight with , if he's still alive .
An Englishman ?
If I may say so , your Majesty , as I see it he would be a coward and a villain not to .
It may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree , quite outside of his own sphere .
Even if he were as important a man as the devil , as Lucifer or Beelzebub himself , he's required , see , your Grace , to keep his vow .
If he backs down , he'll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a Jack as ever walked on God's earth , in my opinion .
Then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
So I will , my liege .
Whom do you serve under ?
Under Captain Gower , my liege .
Gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
Have him come to me here , soldier .
I will , my liege .
Here , Fluellen , stick this in your cap .
Your Grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
Do you know Captain Gower ?
He is my dear friend , your Majesty .
Go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
I'll fetch him .
My Lord of Warwick and my brother Gloucester , follow Fluellen at a close distance .
The glove which I have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
According to an agreement , I should wear it myself .
Follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
You come with me , uncle of Exeter .
I'm sure it is to knight you , Captain .
As it is God's will and pleasure , Captain , I entreat you to come quickly to the king .
Sir , do you recognize this glove ?
Know the glove !
I know the glove is a glove .
Well , I recognize this one Good God !
As absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world , or even France or England !
Do you think I'd break my oath ?
Stand aside , Captain Gower .
I'll reward treason with blows , I promise you .
I'm not a traitor .
Arrest him : he's a friend of the duke of Alencon's .
My Lord of Warwick , a most corrupt treason , God be praised for it ! , has been discovered , as plain as any you'd hope to see on a summer's day .
Here is his Majesty .
My liege , this man is a villain and a traitor , who , see , your Grace , has struck the glove which your Majesty took from Alencon's helmet .
My liege , this was my glove .
I met this man with my glove in his cap , and I have been as good as my word .
Your Majesty , see here , if it won't offend your Grace , what a complete , rascally , beggarly , lousy rat this is .
I hope your Majesty will , in all good conscience , bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of Alencon and that your Majesty gave it to me .
It was I , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
And so you do .
Their bodies may remain here in England , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of France already .
Oh , let their bodies follow , my dear king , to win back what's rightfully yours with blood and sword and fire .
What we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from Scotland , always an unreliable neighbor .
If it pleases your Majesty , let his neck pay the price , if there is any martial law in the world .
How can you square things with me ?
You abused me to my face .
Your Majesty didn't present yourself as the king .
You represented yourself as just a common man .
Anything your Highness suffered in that disguise , I beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine , because if you'd been what I took you for , there would have been no offense .
Therefore , I beg your Highness , pardon me .
I'll have none of your money .
It's meant in good will .
I tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
Come , why be so hesitant ?
Your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
It's a good shilling , I promise you .
Now , herald , have the dead been counted ?
Here is the count of the slaughtered French .
What prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
This paper tells me of ten thousand Frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
Among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
Add to these eight thousand four hundred knights , squires , and brave gentlemen , five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday .
Among the ten thousand the French have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
The rest of the dead are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of birth and rank .
Of brave earls , Grandpre and Roussi , Fauconberg and Foix , Beaumont and Marle , Vaudemont and Lestrale .
Where is the number of our English dead ?
When was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other , in the ordinary and equal clash of battle ?
Take credit , God , for it is no one's doing but yours .
It's unbelievable .
Yes , Captain , but with this acknowledgement , that God fought for us .
Yes , I truly think He did great good .
We'll perform all the holy rites .
As for those who have , I beg you to excuse the gaps in time , and the many people and things that can not be represented here in all their magnitude and proper form .
Let's have him land and solemnly proceed to London .
Thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on Blackheath , where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city .
He refuses , as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to God .
Now in the factory of thought , create the image of all London pouring forth into the streets .
Picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient Rome to welcome home their conquering Caesar .
Skip over all the particularities between then and Harry's return to France .
Saint Davy's Day has passed .
There are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
We were somewhere where I couldn't pick a fight with him , but I've decided to wear it in my cap until I see him again , whereupon I'll give him a little piece of my mind .
And here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
Are you mad ?
Away !
The smell of leek turns my stomach .
I wonder if you'd be so good , you lousy , rotten villain , to grant my wish and my request and gratify me , see , by eating this leek .
I'd like you to , see , because you don't like it , and because it isn't to your taste , and because it doesn't agree with you .
Not for Cadwallader and all his goats .
Here's a goat for you .
Dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
That's very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases God .
Meanwhile , I'd be gratified if you'd live and eat your food .
Come , here's some sauce to go with it .
Enough , Captain .
You've stunned him .
I tell you , I'll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing. , Go on , bite .
It's good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
Must I bite ?
Yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
By this leek , I swear I'll make you pay for this .
Would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
There isn't enough leek left for you to swear on .
Lay off , already !
Can't you see I'm eating ?
I sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
No , don't throw any of it away .
The skin is good for your cracked head .
When you see leeks in the future , I hope you keep mocking them .
Good .
Yes , leeks are good .
Wait , here's a penny to heal your head .
Me , a penny ?
If I owe you anything , I'll pay you in clubbings .
You'll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
God be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
There'll be hell to pay for this .
Go on , get out of here .
You're a lying , cowardly wretch .
You mock an ancient tradition , born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died , and then have the gall not to stand by your words .
I've seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
You thought because he didn't speak English like a native he couldn't handle an English club .
Farewell .
Has Fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
I've had news that my Nell died of the pox in a hospice .
I grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
Well , I'll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
I'll steal away to England , and I'll steal some more when I get there .
I'll bandage up these wounds and swear I got them in the French wars .
But here's an old , true saying : "If you want to win France , start with Scotland." For when the eagle England leaves her nest to seek prey , the weasel Scot always comes sneaking around to suck dry her princely eggs and , like the mouse when the cat's away , destroy more than she can actually eat .
It would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
But that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves .
While the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
We rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of England .
You are welcome here , as are all of you English princes .
We hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
We're here to say "amen" to that .
All you English princes , I salute you .
Great kings of France and England , I owe you both equal service and loyalty .
Your Highnesses can both attest to the fact that I've strived mightily , with all my wits and energy , to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial Majesties .
Alas , she has been too long exiled from France , whose crops all lie in heaps , rotting with ripeness .
Her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
Her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
Her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
The level meadow , where the freckled cowslip , burnet , and green clover once grew , has become useless : unmowed , it grows to seed , so that nothing springs up but weeds , rough thistles , barren plants , and burs .
children have lost , or no longer have time to learn , skills that should be a credit to our country .
They grow like savages , like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood , surrounded by swearing and stern looks , ragged clothing and everything unnatural .
Duke of Burgundy , if you want peace , the lack of which creates these misfortunes you describe , you must purchase it buy agreeing across-the-board to all our very just demands .
The king has heard them , but as yet has made no answer .
Well , the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .
I've only given the articles a cursory glance .
If your Grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully , I will give my answer and acceptance right away .
Fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
Gracious brother , I will go with them .
Perhaps a woman's voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up .
In that case , leave our cousin Katherine here with us .
She is our principal demand , one of the first points of the treaty .
She is welcome to stay .
Lovely , most lovely Katherine , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours ?
Your Majesty shall mock at me .
I can not speak your England .
Lovely Katherine , if you will love me well with your French heart , I'm happy to hear you confess it in broken English .
Do you like me , Kate ?
Pardon me but I do not know what is "like me." An angel is like you , Kate , and you are like an angel .
I said so , dear Katherine , and I'm not ashamed to repeat it .
Kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : I am glad your English isn't better .
If it were , you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think I'd sold my farm to buy my crown .
I don't know any fancy ways of talking about love , only to say right out , "I love you." If you press me any further than with the question , "Do you really ? " my love scene is over .
So give me your answer , and we'll shake on it .
Deal ?
I have no gift for the one and no strength for the other , though I have the gift of strength .
If I could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back , though you may accuse me of boasting , I could easily get myself a wife .
If you can love a man of this temperament , Kate , whose face a sunburn wouldn't make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself , let your eye improve me .
I speak to you as a plain soldier .
If you can love me for this , take me .
If not , to tell you I will die is true , but not for love , by God .
And yet I do love you .
So take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
These chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady's good graces always reason themselves out again .
If you would have such a man , take me .
So what do you say to my suit ?
Speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , I beg you .
Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France ?
No , it is not possible you should love the enemy of France , Kate .
But in loving me , you would love the friend of France , for I love France so much that I will not part with a single village of it .
I will have it all mine .
And , Kate , when France is mine and I am yours , then France is yours and you are mine .
I don't understand all dat .
No , Kate ?
Can any of your neighbors tell , Kate ?
I'll ask them .
But mock me gently , dear Kate , because I love you terribly .
Shall we not ?
What do you say , my fair I do not know dat .
No , of course you don't .
Now there can only be the promise .
Do promise , Kate , that you'll do your French part to bring forth such a boy ; and for my English half , take the word of a king and a bachelor .
I tell you truly , in true English : I love you , Kate .
And though I wouldn't dare to swear that you love me , still my blood begins to flatter me that you do , despite the ill effects of my face .
Curse my father's ambition !
But I promise you , Kate : the older I grow the better I'll look .
My comfort is that old age , that poor preserver of beauty , can't make my face any worse than it already is .
If you have me , you have me now at my worst ; and if you have me , you'll appreciate me better and better .
Therefore tell me , fairest Katherine , will you have me ?
Take me by the hand and say , "Harry of England , I am yours." No sooner shall I hear that word than I will tell you straight out , "England is yours , Ireland is yours , France is yours , and Harry Plantagenet
is yours." And , though I say so in his presence , if he's not a friend of the best kings , you'll find him king of the best friends .
Come on , tell me in broken music , for your voice is music and your English broken .
Come , Katherine Queen of All , reveal your heart to me in broken English .
Will you have me ?
Den it shall also content me .
With that I kiss your hand and call you my queen .
Then I will kiss your lips , Kate .
What does she say , madam interpreter ?
Dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of France , I can not tell vat is To kiss .
It is not the custom for the maids in France to kiss before they are married , is that what she says ?
Oh , Kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
You and I can not be held within the confines of a country's arbitrary customs , dear Kate .
You and I , Kate , we are the makers of custom , and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize , as I will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss .
Therefore , willingly and yielding .
God save your Majesty .
My royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess English ?
I wanted to teach her how perfectly I love her , kinsman , and that's good English .
She picks it up quick , doesn't she ?
So , possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery , I can't awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness .
From this , I conclude that many different elements can work toward one common end , just as many arrows , shot from different points , converge on a single target ; just as many roads meet in a single town ; just as many fresh streams empty into only one salt sea ; just as the many radiuses of a
Forgive my boldness if I take you up on your words about making magic .
For love to appear in his true likeness , he would have to be as Cupid is : naked and blind .
How can you blame her , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes , for objecting to having a blind , naked boy appear before her ?
It's a lot to ask of a maiden .
They're forgiven , then , if they don't see what they're doing .
Then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
So you're telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
And even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
Like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
Fair enough .
Shall Kate be my wife ?
If you wish .
I am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
That way , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire .
We have consented to all reasonable terms .
Is that true , my lords of England ?
The king has agreed to every point : first his daughter , then everything else , as you strictly proposed .
Except that he has not yet agreed to address you in this form and with this title , in French , And even this I'm willing to grant if you request it .
In that case , I ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest , and bestow your daughter on me .
Amen .
Now , welcome , Kate. , And let everyone bear witness that here I kiss her as my sovereign queen .
May God , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
God say , "Amen" !
Amen !
Let us prepare for our wedding. , On that day , I'll take your oath of loyalty , my Lord of Burgundy and all my peers , to guarantee my treaty .
Then I will swear to Kate and you to me , and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate .
Thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude , inadequate writing , keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history's full glory with his uneven telling .
Henry the Sixth , crowned king of France and England while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
With those plays in mind , we hope you'll receive this one kindly .
If we can not defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin .
I'm ready now to hear what my good cousin the Dauphin has to say , for I hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
Will your Majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we've been asked to convey ?
Let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
Divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
Imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth .
I am no tyrant but a Christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons .
Therefore tell me the Dauphin's mind frankly and without constraint .
You can't party your way into dukedoms there .
And in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
This is the Dauphin's message .
What's the treasure , uncle ?
Tennis balls , my liege .
I'm happy the Dauphin has such a good sense of humor .
Thank you for his present and your trouble .
Once I've put my rackets to these balls , I'll play a set in France , God willing , that will knock his father's crown right out of the court .
And I understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
Men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they're away from home .
So go in peace .
And tell the Dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
That was a humorous message .
I hope to make the sender blush for it .
Now , lords , don't let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
Therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
Now all the young men of England are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
shifts , friends , to Southampton .
From there we'll safely carry you to France and back , calming the waters of the Channel to provide you with a smooth voyage .
But we won't shift the scene to Southampton until Henry reappears .
Good to see you , Corporal Nym .
Good day , Lieutenant Bardolph .
Tell me , are you and Ensign Pistol friends again yet ?
For my part , I really don't care .
Then we can all three be comrades on our way to France .
How about it , Corporal Nym ?
That's it .
It's not for me to say .
Things are what they are .
Men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
There must be some resolution .
Well , it's not for me to say .
Here comes Ensign Pistol and his wife .
I swear , I scorn the word .
Oh , dear .
Pish !
Pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared Icelandic mutt .
Corporal Nym , be a man and put away your sword .
Get lost , will you ?
I am not some fiend of hell : you can't get rid of me with spells .
I'm in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
If you get nasty with me , Pistol , I'll stab you with my sword , in fair play .
Your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
So take your last breath .
Listen , listen to what I say : whoever strikes first , I'll run him through with my sword , as sure as I'm a soldier .
That's an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
That's enough .
I swear , he'll be food for the crows soon .
The king has broken his heart .
Good husband , come home soon .
Come on , can I get you two to make up ?
Let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
Are you going to pay the eight shillings I won from you in a bet ?
Paying debts is for peasants .
I'm going to take it from you now .
We'll see , won't we ?
Do your best .
By this sword , I'll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
By this sword , I will .
By this sword" is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
Come on , put it away .
In cash .
Well , then , that's how it is .
If you ever had a mother , come in quickly to Sir John .
The poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it's terrible to see .
Sweet men , come to him .
And , as the speaker of any prologue should , I ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
Nym , what you say is true .
He has his moods and his ways .
How smooth and cool they seem !
Just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
The king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
Now that the wind is favorable , let's board the ship .
My Lord of Cambridge and my good Lord of Masham and you , my noble knight , what do you think ?
Will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of France , achieving and accomplishing everything I've assembled them to do ?
No doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
I have no doubt about that , since I know there isn't a man among us who isn't with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who doesn't wish us success and conquest .
There never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your Majesty .
I don't think there's a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
True .
Those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness , serving you loyally and wholeheartedly .
Yes , I have great cause to be thankful .
Uncle of Exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
That's merciful but a bit careless .
Oh , let us be merciful anyway .
And now , let's turn to our business with the French .
Who are the new commissioners ?
I am one , my lord .
Your Highness told me to ask for my commission today .
You told me to do the same , my liege .
And me , too , my royal sovereign .
I confess my crime and throw myself on your Highness's mercy .
To which we all appeal .
The mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
Though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , I can scarcely believe it , it's so past understanding .
All other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
and patches of righteousness .
But the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .
The demon who seduced you could stride the world over with the proud gait of a lion , could return to hell and tell the devil's legions , "I will never win another soul as easily as I won that Englishman's." How you have poisoned my faith in people !
Why , so did you .
Why , so did you .
Do they come from good families ?
Why , so did you .
Do they seem religious ?
Why , so did you .
That's how sound a man you appeared .
Your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
This treachery of yours is like the second
Richard Earl of Cambridge , I arrest you for high treason .
Henry Lord Scroop of Masham , I arrest you for high treason .
Thomas Grey , knight , of Northumberland , I arrest you for high treason .
I regret my crime more than my death , and I beg your Highness to forgive me , while punishing my body with death .
But I thank God that I failed in my scheme , and I rejoice in paying the penalty , as I beg God and you to pardon me .
No faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than I now rejoice that I was thwarted in a damnable undertaking .
Pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
May God in His mercy forgive you .
I seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do I hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .
So go to your deaths , poor miserable wretches , the pain of which may merciful God give you the strength to endure .
I have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war , since God so graciously exposed this dangerous plot .
I'm now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
Let's go forth , dear countrymen .
I'll be no king of England if I'm not also king of France .
No , because my manly heart is grieving .
Bardolph , be happy. , Nym , rouse your bragging spirits. , Boy , be brave .
Oh , no , he's surely not in hell .
He's in They say he cried out against sherry .
Yes , he did .
And women .
No , he did not .
He could never bear carnation .
It was a color he never did like .
He once said the devil would get him because of women .
He did touch on women a bit , but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the Whore of Babylon .
Don't you remember how he saw a flea land on Bardolph's nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
Well , the Shall we get moving ?
The king will already have left Southampton .
Look after my goods and possessions .
My lord , this bill that's being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old King Henry's reign .
Everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
But how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
We have to think about that .
If it does pass , the Church will lose more than half of what it possesses , because the bill would strip us of enough real estate left to the church by wealthy , pious men in their wills to support fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights , six thousand two hundred squires , and a hundred well-supplied almshouses for the relief of lepers , old-age pensioners , the poor , and those too weak or sick to work .
That's what the bill says .
But what can be done to prevent it ?
The king is virtuous and kind .
And a true lover of the holy Church .
I've heard that's not the most nourishing food .
Kiss her soft mouth , and we'll be off .
Farewell , hostess .
Be thrifty .
And keep yourself hidden , I command you .
Farewell .
Adieu .
Therefore the dukes of Berri , Bretagne , Brabant , and Orleans shall advance , and you , Prince Dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
The king of England's approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
Let's do it with no show of anxiety , no , with no more fear than if we'd heard that the English were busying themselves with folk dancing .
Because , my good king , England is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she's hardly a threat .
Oh , please , Prince Dauphin !
You are completely wrong about this king .
Talk to the ambassadors who've just come back : ask them how majestically he responded to their message , how well supplied he was with good advisors , how restrained in expressing his displeasure , and , moreover , how terrifyingly firm he was in his resolve .
You'll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that Well , you're wrong , my Lord High Constable .
But even if I thought you were right , it doesn't matter .
When it comes to defense , it's best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems .
crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , French youth whose fathers and God had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
This king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
Ambassadors of Harry , king of England , request a hearing with your Majesty .
We'll see them immediately .
Bring them right in .
My good King , surprise the English and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
Self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
From our brother monarch , the king of England ?
And what will happen if I don't ?
Bloodshed will force you to .
I'll think it over .
Tomorrow , I'll let you know what I've decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of England .
Regarding the Dauphin , you can speak to me .
What's the message from the English king ?
Scorn and defiance , indifference , contempt , and any insult that wouldn't disgrace the mighty sender , that's the value he puts on you .
And my king goes on : if your royal father does not sweeten the bitter insult you sent my king and grant all our demands , Henry's artillery will give you so resounding an answer that the very caves and vaulted cathedrals of France shall echo your mocking of him back in your face .
To that end , I presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .
He'll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of Europe .
And , make no mistake , you'll find , as we his subjects have , an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now .
We'll give you an answer tomorrow .
Don't take too long , unless you want our king to come after me to ask what's holding things up , because he's already landed here .
You'll have your answer soon .
A night isn't much time for addressing matters of this importance .
And so , on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought , our scene flies swiftly on .
Picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
Hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
Picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea , breasting the high waves .
Pretend that you're standing on the shore , watching a city dance on the shifting waves , and you'll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for Harfleur .
Follow it , follow it !
Once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
Take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of Harfleur .
Imagine the French ambassador returning to inform Harry that the king offers him
his daughter , Katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
Indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
Attack the breach in the city wall once more , dear friends , attack it once more , or else let's close it up with English corpses .
Now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
On , on , you noblest Englishmen , descended as you are from battle-tested fathers , fathers who , like so many Alexander the Greats , have fought in these regions from morning until night , sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight .
Don't dishonor your mothers !
Prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
And you , good farmers , whose limbs were made in England , show us here the vigor of your upbringing .
Prove you are worthy of your birth , which I do not doubt for a moment .
We are fortunate in the change .
Listen to him talk about war , and you'll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
Follow your spirit , and as you charge cry , "God for Harry , England , and Saint George ! "
On , on , on , on , on !
To the breach , to the breach !
Please , corporal , stop !
You can see how it is all around .
I wish I were in an alehouse in London !
I would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
Me too .
Up to the breach , you dogs !
Go !
Great Duke , be merciful to mortal men .
Dear man , calm your rage .
Be lenient , dearest !
This is healthy talk .
Your Honor's is unhealthy talk .
Young though I am , I've been observing these three blowhards closely .
Yet not one among them , if all three were to wait on me , could be my "man , " because three such fakes don't amount to a man .
They will steal anything and call it spoils .
They would like me to be as familiar with men's pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs , which goes against my manhood , because to take something from another's pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing .
I must leave them and seek some better employment .
Their villainy nauseates me , and I must therefore vomit it up .
The tunnels !
For the enemy , see , and you can explain this to the duke , see , has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours .
By Jesus , I think they will blow up everything if we don't improve our tactics .
The duke of Gloucester , who has command over the siege , is in consultation with an Irishman , a very valiant gentleman indeed .
It's Captain Macmorris , right ?
I think so .
Jesus , he's an ass if there ever was one !
I will say as much to his face .
He knows no more about the proper practice of war , see , the ancient practices , than a puppy .
Here he comes with Captain Jamy , the Scots captain .
Captain Jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman , that's certain , one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare , I happen to know from his maneuvers .
By Jesus , he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient Roman wars as well as any military man in the world .
Good day to you , Captain Fluellen .
Good evening to your Worship , good Captain James .
Tell me , Captain Macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
Have the excavators stopped work ?
Christ , it's a disaster .
I swear by this hand and my father's soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
It's all stopped .
I could have blown up the town in an hour .
Oh , it's a disaster , a disaster , by this hand , it's a disaster .
Captain Macmorris , I beg your pardon , but would you grant me a discussion or two with you , see , partly touching on or concerning the practice of war , the Roman wars , for the sake of argument , see , and friendly conversation ?
Partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction , see , of my mind , with respect to the demands of proper military practice , that's the point ?
What endeavor , Popillius ?
Good luck .
Look , he's approaching Caesar .
Keep an eye on him .
Brutus , what will we do ?
If our secret's known , either Caesar or I will die , for I'll kill myself .
Cassius , stand firm .
Trebonius knows his cue .
Where's Metellus Cimber ?
He should go up and offer his petition to Caesar now .
They're speaking to him .
Go up there and second his petition .
Casca , you'll be the first to raise your hand .
Are we all ready ?
I have to stop you , Cimber .
These kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men , flattering them into turning Roman law into children's games .
What , even you , Brutus ?
I could be convinced if I were like you .
If I could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
But I'm as immovable as the northern star , whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky .
The sky shows countless stars .
So it is on earth .
To show you that that's me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
Enough !
Would you try to lift Mount Olympus ?
Haven't I resisted even Brutus , begging from his knees ?
Hands , speak for me !
Liberty !
Freedom !
Tyranny is dead !
Run and proclaim it in the streets .
Some should go to the public platforms and cry out , "Liberty , freedom , and democracy ! " People and senators , don't be afraid .
Don't run away , stay where you are .
Go to the platform , Brutus .
And Cassius too .
Where's Publius ?
Stand close together , in case someone loyal to Caesar tries to , Don't talk about standing together. , Publius , cheer up .
We don't intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
Tell them this , Publius .
And leave us , Publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
Do so .
And let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
Where's Antony ?
He ran to his house , stunned .
Men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run in the streets as though it were doomsday .
Why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
Kneel , Romans , kneel , and let's wash our hands , up to the elbows , in Caesar's blood and smear it on our swords .
Then we'll go out , even to the marketplace , and , waving our bloody swords over our heads , let's cry , "Peace , freedom , and liberty ! " Kneel then , and wash .
Who's calling me ?
Quiet , everyone !
Quiet !
Who in the crowd is calling me ?
I hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling "Caesar ! " Speak .
Caesar is listening .
Beware of March 15th .
Who's that ?
A soothsayer tells you to beware of March 15th .
Bring him in front of me .
Let me see his face .
You , fellow , step out of the crowd .
This is Caesar you're looking at .
What do you have to say to me now ?
Speak once again .
Beware of March 15th .
He's insane .
Let's leave him .
Let's move .
Are you going to watch the race ?
How many times will Caesar bleed again in show , though he now lies at the base of Pompey's statue , as worthless as dust !
Yes , every man forward .
Brutus will lead , and we'll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of Rome .
Wait a minute .
Who's that coming ?
It's a friend of Antony's .
Your master is a wise and honorable Roman .
I never thought any less of him .
Tell him , if he comes here , I'll explain everything to him and , on my word , he'll leave unharmed .
I know that he'll be on our side .
But here comes Antony. , Welcome , Mark Antony .
Oh , mighty Caesar !
Do you lie so low ?
Have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
Farewell .
Gentlemen , I don't know what you intend to do , who else you intend to kill , who else you consider corrupt .
If it's me , there's no time as good as this hour of Caesar's death , and no weapon better than your swords , covered with the noblest blood in the world .
I ask you , if you have a grudge against me , to kill me now , while your stained hands still reek of blood .
I could live a thousand years and I wouldn't be as ready to die as I am now .
There's no place I'd rather die than here by Caesar , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you , the masters of this new era .
Oh , Antony , don't beg us to kill you .
They are full of pity for Caesar .
But a stronger pity , for the wrongs committed against Rome , drove out our pity for Caesar , as fire drives out fire , and so we killed him .
For you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , Mark Antony .
Our arms , which can be strong and cruel , and our hearts , filled with brotherly love , embrace you with kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
Your vote will be as strong as anyone's in the reordering of the government .
But just be patient until we've calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
I don't doubt your wisdom .
Each of you , give me your bloody hand .
Mark Antony , Pardon me , Caius Cassius .
I took your hands in friendship , but , indeed , I was distracted when I looked down at Caesar .
I am friends with you all and love you all , on one condition , that you prove to me that Caesar was dangerous .
Our reasons are so well considered that even if you , Antony , were Caesar's son , you would be satisfied with them .
You may , Mark Antony .
Brutus , may I have a word with you ?
It'll help us more than hurt us .
Mark Antony , take Caesar's body .
You will not blame us in your funeral speech , but will say all the good you want to about Caesar and that you do it by our permission .
And you'll speak on the same platform as I do , after I'm done .
So be it .
I don't want anything more .
Prepare the body , then , and follow us .
You are what's left of the noblest man that ever lived .
Pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
Over your wounds , which , like speechless mouths , open their red lips , as though to beg me to speak , I predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men .
Fierce civil war will paralyze all of Italy .
I do , Mark Antony .
Caesar wrote for him to come to Rome .
He received Caesar's letters , and he is coming .
Grief seems to be contagious , for my eyes , seeing the tears in yours , began to fill .
Is your master coming ?
He rests tonight within twenty-one miles of Rome .
Report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
Don't go back until I've carried the corpse into the marketplace .
Help me here .
We want answers .
Give us answers .
Then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
Cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
Let those who will hear me speak stay .
Lead those away who will follow you , and we'll explain publicly the reasons for Caesar's death .
I'll listen to Brutus .
I'll listen to Cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
Noble Brutus has mounted the platform .
Be patient until I finish .
Romans , countrymen , and friends !
Listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
Believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
Be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
If there's anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of Caesar's , I say to him that my love for Caesar was no less than his .
If , then , that friend demands to know why I rose up against Caesar , this is my answer : it's not that I loved Caesar less , but that I loved Rome more .
Would you rather that Caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves , or that Caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?
I weep for Caesar in that he was good to me .
I rejoice in his good fortune .
I honor him for being brave .
But his ambition , for that , I killed him .
There are tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his bravery , and death for his ambition .
Who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
Who here is so barbarous that he doesn't want to be a Roman ?
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I've offended .
Who here is so vile that he doesn't love his country ?
If there are any , speak , for it is he whom I have offended .
I will pause for a reply .
No one , Brutus , no one .
Then I have offended no one .
I've done no more to Caesar than you will do to me .
The reasons for his death are recorded in the Capitol .
His glory has not been diminished where he earned it , nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated .
Here comes his body , mourned by Mark Antony , who , though he had no part in the killing , will benefit from his death , receiving a share in the commonwealth , as you all will .
Live , Brutus !
Live , live !
Let's carry him in triumph to his house !
I don't like sports .
I'm not competitive like Antony .
But don't let me keep you from going , Cassius .
I'll go my own way .
Cassius , don't take it badly .
Tell me , good Brutus , can you see your face ?
Let him become Caesar !
Caesar's better qualities exist in Brutus , and we will crown him .
We'll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
My countrymen , Silence !
Brutus speaks .
Quiet there !
Good countrymen , let me leave alone .
I ask that none of you leave , except myself , until Antony has finished .
Let him mount the pulpit .
We'll listen to him .
For Brutus's sake , I am indebted to you .
What does he say about Brutus ?
He says that for Brutus's sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
He'd better not speak badly of Brutus here .
Caesar was a tyrant .
That's for sure .
We're lucky that Rome is rid of him .
Quiet !
Let's hear what Antony has to say .
You gentle Romans , Quiet there !
Let us hear him .
Friends , Romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
I have come here to bury Caesar , not to praise him .
The evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
It might as well be the same with Caesar .
The noble Brutus told you that Caesar was ambitious .
If that's true , it's a serious fault , and Caesar has paid seriously for it .
With the permission of Brutus and the others , for Brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men , I have come here to speak at Caesar's funeral .
He was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
But Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
He brought many captives home to Rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
Is this the work of an ambitious man ?
When the poor cried , Caesar cried too .
Ambition shouldn't be so soft .
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious , and Brutus is an honorable man .
You all saw that on the Lupercal feast day I offered him a king's crown three times , and he refused it three times .
Was this ambition ?
I am not here to disprove what Brutus has said , but to say what I think there's a lot of sense in what he says .
If you think about it correctly , Caesar has suffered a great wrong .
Has he , sirs ?
Caesar wouldn't take the crown .
Therefore it's certain that he wasn't ambitious .
If it turns out he wasn't , certain people are going to get it .
Poor man !
Antony's eyes are fiery red from crying .
There isn't a nobler man than Antony in all of Rome .
Only yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world .
Now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
Oh , sirs , if I stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , I would offend Brutus and Cassius , who , you all know , are honorable men .
I will not do them wrong .
I would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
But here's a paper with Caesar's seal on it .
If you could only hear this testament , which , excuse me , I don't intend to read aloud , you would kiss dead Caesar's wounds and dip your handkerchiefs in his sacred blood , and beg for a lock of hair to remember him by .
We want to hear the will .
Read it , Mark Antony .
The will , the will !
We want to hear Caesar's will .
It isn't proper for you to know how much Caesar loved you .
You aren't wood , you aren't stones , you're men .
And , being men , the contents of Caesar's will would enrage you .
Read the will .
We want to hear it , Antony .
You have to read us the will , Caesar's will .
Will you be patient ?
Will you wait awhile ?
I've said too much in telling you of it .
I'm afraid that I wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed Caesar .
They were traitors .
The testament !
They were villains , murderers .
The will !
Read the will !
You force me to read the will , then ?
Then make a circle around Caesar's corpse , and let me show you the man who made this will .
Shall I come down ?
Will you let me ?
Come down .
Descend .
We'll let you .
Stand away from the hearse .
Stand away from the body .
Make room for Antony , most noble Antony !
No , don't press up against me .
Stand further away .
Stand back .
Give him room .
If you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
You all know this cloak .
I remember the first time Caesar ever put it on .
It was the day he overcame the Nervii warriors .
Look , here's where Cassius's dagger pierced it .
See the wound that Casca made .
For Brutus , as you know , was Caesar's angel .
The gods know how dearly Caesar loved him !
This was the most unkind cut of all .
And at the base of Pompey's statue , with his cloak covering his face , which was dripping with blood the whole time , great Caesar fell .
Oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
Then you and I and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
Oh , now you weep , and I sense that you feel pity .
These are gracious tears .
But if it overwhelms you to look at Caesar's wounded cloak , how will you feel , kind men , now ?
Look at this , here is the man , scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
Oh , what a sad sight !
Oh , noble Caesar !
Oh , sad day !
Oh , traitors , villains !
Oh , most bloody sight !
Revenge !
Seek !
Burn !
Set fire !
Kill !
Slay !
Wait , countrymen .
Quiet there !
Listen to the noble Antony .
Those who have done this deed are honorable .
I don't know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
They're wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
I haven't come to steal your loyalty , friends .
I have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up .
I just speak directly .
But if I were Brutus and Brutus were me , then I'd stir you up , and install in each of Caesar's wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny .
We'll mutiny .
We'll burn Brutus's house .
Let's go , then !
Come , find the conspirators !
Wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
Quiet !
Wait !
Listen to Antony .
Most noble Antony !
Why , friends , you don't even know what you're doing yet .
What has Caesar done to deserve your love ?
Alas , you don't know .
I must tell you then .
You've forgotten the will I told you about .
Yes !
The will !
Let's stay and hear the will !
Most noble Caesar !
We'll revenge his death .
Oh , royal Caesar !
Listen to me patiently .
Quiet , there !
Also , he's left you all his walkways , in his private gardens and newly planted orchards , on this side of the Tiber River .
He's left them to you and to your heirs forever , public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax .
Here was a Caesar !
When will there be another like him ?
We'll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors ' houses on fire .
Take up the body .
We'll start a fire .
Now , let it work .
What's up , my man ?
Sir , Octavius has already arrived in Rome .
Where is he ?
He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house .
I will go straight to visit him .
I ask for him , and he comes .
Fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
I heard Octavius say that Brutus and Cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of Rome .
They probably received warning about how much I stirred up the people .
Take me to Octavius .
That's true .
And it's too bad , Brutus , that you don't have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself .
I've heard many of the noblest Romans , next to immortal Caesar , speaking of you , complaining of the tyranny of today's government , and wishing that your eyes were working better .
What dangers are you trying to lead me into , Cassius , that you want me to look inside myself for something that's not there ?
I'll tell you , good Brutus .
And since you know you can see yourself best by reflection , I'll be your mirror and show you , without exaggeration , things inside you that you can't see .
And don't be suspicious of me , noble Brutus .
If I were your average fool , or if I made my feelings for you worthless by making the same promises of friendship to everybody , or if you'd seen me first flattering men , hugging them tightly , and later slandering them behind their backs , or if you hear that I drunkenly declare friendship at banquets with all the rabble , only then , of course , go ahead and assume I'm dangerous .
Why are they shouting ?
I'm afraid the people have made Caesar their king .
Really , are you afraid of that ?
Then I have to assume you don't want him to be king .
I dreamed last night that I feasted with Caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
I have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
What's your name ?
Where are you going ?
Where do you live ?
Are you a married man or a bachelor ?
Answer all of us , now .
Yes , and be brief .
Yes , and be wise .
What's my name ?
Where am I going ?
Where do I live ?
Am I a married man or a bachelor ?
Then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully , wisely I say , I am a bachelor .
You imply that married men are fools .
You'll get a blow from me for that , I think .
Right this instant , I'm going to Caesar's funeral .
As a friend or an enemy ?
As a friend .
Getting right to the point , I live near the Capitol .
Tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
Truthfully , my name is Cinna .
Tear him to pieces .
He's a conspirator .
I'm not Cinna the conspirator .
It doesn't matter .
His name's Cinna .
Pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
Tear him apart , tear him up !
Come , firebrands , over here !
To Brutus's , to Cassius's , let's burn them all .
Some of you go to Decius's house and some to Casca's .
Some to Ligarius's .
Go !
These ones , then , will be assassinated .
Their names are marked .
I agree , Put a mark next to his name too , Antony .
On the condition that your sister's son , Publius , also must die , Mark Antony .
He will die .
See , I've sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
But , Lepidus , go to Caesar's house .
Bring his will here , and we'll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people .
Will you be here when I return ?
Either here or at the Capitol .
He's an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
Does it really make sense , once we divide the world into three parts , that he should be one of the three rulers ?
Octavius , I'm older than you are .
And although we're giving these honors to this man so that he shares some of the blame for what we're doing , he'll carry these honors like a jackass carries gold , groaning and sweating under the load , either led or pushed , as we direct him .
Once he's carried our treasure where we want it , we'll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures .
You can do what you want , but he's an experienced and honorable soldier .
So is my horse , Octavius , and for that reason I give him all the hay he wants .
Stop .
Pass on the command to halt !
What's happening now , Lucillius ?
Is Cassius nearby ?
He's nearby , and Pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
If he's nearby , I want an explanation .
Can I have a word with you , Lucillius ?
He received me with courtesy and sufficient respect , but not with affection , nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me .
You've described a warm friend who's cooling off .
Plain and simple loyalty doesn't make anyone act phony .
But insincere men , like horses who are too lively at the start of a race , make a big show of their spirit .
But when push comes to shove , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl .
Is his army approaching ?
They plan to spend the night in Sardis .
The larger part , the main body of cavalry , are coming with Cassius .
Look !
He's arrived .
March to meet him at a dignified pace .
Halt .
Halt !
Pass the order along .
Halt !
Halt !
Halt !
Most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
Let the gods judge me !
Do I mistreat even my enemies ?
And when you do , Cassius , calm down .
Let's not argue here in front of both our armies , which ought to see nothing but love between us .
Order them to move back .
Then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and I'll listen .
Pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
Have Lucius and Titinius guard the door .
My evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced Lucius Pella for taking bribes here from the Sardinians , and you ignored my letters , where I argued that he was innocent ; I know the man .
You wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
In a time like this , it doesn't make sense to criticize every offense .
I'll tell you , Cassius , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold .
Me , "greedy" !
You know , if you were anyone other than Brutus , that speech would be your last .
The name of Cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
Unpunished !
Remember March , March 15th .
Didn't great Caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
Who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
Should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on ?
I'd rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of Roman .
Brutus , do not provoke me .
I will not take it .
You're forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
I'm a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
Get lost !
You are not , Cassius .
I am .
I say you're not .
Don't provoke me any further or I'll forget to restrain myself .
If you care about your health , you won't push me any further .
Leave , you little man .
Is this possible ?
Listen to me , for I have something to tell you .
Does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
But why do you keep me here so long ?
What do you want to tell me ?
I know this quality in you , Brutus , it's as familiar to me as your face .
Indeed , honor is what I want to talk to you about .
I don't know what you and other men think of this life , but as for me , I'd rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself .
I was born as free as Caesar .
So were you .
We both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
Once , on a cold and windy day , when the river Tiber was crashing against its banks , Caesar said to me , "Cassius , I dare you to jump into this rough water with me and swim to that point there." As soon as he spoke , though I was fully dressed , I plunged in and called for him to follow .
And he did .
But before we reached the end point , Caesar cried , "Help me , Cassius , or I will sink ! " And just as Aeneas , the hero who founded Rome , emerged from the fires of Troy with his elderly father Anchises on his shoulder , so I emerged from the Tiber carrying the tired Caesar .
All this" ?
Yes , and more .
Go ahead , rage till your proud heart breaks .
Show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
Has it come to this ?
You say you're a better soldier .
Show it !
Make your boasts come true , and I'll be thrilled .
I'm always happy to hear about brave men .
You wrong me in every way .
You wrong me , Brutus .
When Caesar was alive , even he wouldn't dare anger me like this .
Oh , be quiet .
You wouldn't have dared to tempt him so .
I wouldn't have dared !
No .
You wouldn't have dared , out of fear for your life .
Don't take my love for granted .
I might do something I'll be sorry for .
You've already done something you should be sorry for .
Your threats don't scare me , Cassius , because I'm so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
I asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn't give it to me .
Was that the Caius Cassius that I knew ?
And would I have ever done that to you ?
I didn't refuse you .
You did .
I didn't .
The man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
You have broken my heart .
A friend should put up with his friend's weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
I don't until you practice them on me .
You don't love me .
I don't like your faults .
A friend would never see those faults .
No , a flatterer wouldn't , even if the faults were as huge as Mount Olympus .
Oh , I could weep my soul right out of myself !
There's my dagger Put away your dagger .
Be angry whenever you like , it's all right with me .
Do whatever you want , and I'll say your insults are just a bad mood .
When I said that , I was angry too .
You admit it , then ?
Give me your hand .
And my heart too .
Oh , Brutus !
What's the matter ?
Do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper , which I inherited from my mother , makes me forget how I should behave ?
Yes , Cassius .
And from now on , when you get hot with me , I'll assume it's your mother speaking and leave it at that .
What's this !
What's the matter ?
You should be ashamed , generals !
What do you think you're doing ?
Love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
Listen to me , because I'm older than you , surely .
Be patient with him , Brutus .
That's just how he is .
I'll humor him when he learns how to behave .
What should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
Get out of here , my friend .
Away , away , be gone .
Lucillius and Titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
And return to us immediately , bringing Messala with you .
I didn't think you could even be so angry .
Oh Cassius , I'm tired out by many sorrows .
Portia is dead .
Portia !
She is dead .
What an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
What sickness did she die of ?
She was worried about my absence , and about the fact that young Octavius and Mark Antony have grown so strong , which I found out at the same time as the news of her death .
And that's how she died ?
Yes , like that .
Oh , immortal gods !
My heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
Fill my cup , Lucius , until the wine overflows it .
I can not drink too much of Brutus's love .
Now let's sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
Portia , are you really gone ?
No more about that , please .
Messala , I have received these letters explaining that young Octavius and Mark Antony are rushing toward Philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power .
I have received letters that say the same .
And anything else ?
That with a series of legal writs , Octavius , Antony , and Lepidus have put a hundred senators to death .
On that point , our letters don't agree .
My letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being Cicero .
Cicero too ?
Cicero is dead , by their decree .
No , Messala .
And you haven't heard any news about her in your letters ?
Nothing , Messala .
I think that's strange .
Why do you ask ?
Have you heard something of her in your letters ?
No , my lord .
Now , as you're a Roman , tell me the truth .
Then you must take the truth I have to tell like a Roman .
It's certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
Well , good-bye , Portia .
We all must die , Messala .
Having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime , I can endure her death now .
That's the way great men ought to endure great losses .
I've practiced Stoicism with as much devotion as you , but I still couldn't bear this news like you do .
Well , let's move on to our work with the living .
What do you think of marching to Philippi immediately ?
I don't think it's a good idea .
Why not ?
Here's why : it'd be better for the enemy to come after us .
That way , he'll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers , weakening his own capacities , while we , lying still , are rested , energetic , and nimble .
If we meet him at Philippi , these people will be at our backs .
Listen to me , good brother .
Our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
The enemy gets larger each day .
We , now at our largest , can only decrease .
It's on such a high tide that we're now floating , and we must take the current when it is offered , or lose our campaign .
If that's what you want , all right .
We'll go forward with you and meet them at Philippi .
It's now late at night , and actions must accommodate bodily needs , which we'll satisfy with only a short rest .
That's all there is to say .
There's nothing else .
Good night .
We'll rise and leave early tomorrow .
Lucius !
Let's pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
Let's not , Brutus .
And this is the man who has now become a god , and I'm a wretched creature who must bow down if Caesar so much as carelessly nods my way .
In Spain , Caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
It's true , this so-called "god" , he shook .
His cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
I heard him groan , yes , I did , and the same tongue that ordered the Romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried , "Give me some water , Titinius , " like a sick girl .
It astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone .
More shouting !
I think this applause is for some new honors awarded to Caesar .
Why , Caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably , as slaves .
Men can be masters of their fate .
It is not destiny's fault , but our own faults , that we're slaves .
Brutus" and "Caesar." What's so special about "Caesar" ?
Why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
Write them together , yours is just as good a name .
Pronounce them , it is just as nice to say .
Everything's fine .
Good night , my lord .
Good night , good brother .
Good night , Lord Brutus .
Farewell , everyone .
Give me the gown .
Where's your lute ?
Here in the tent .
What , are you sleepy ?
Call Claudio and some of my other men .
I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
Varrus and Claudio !
Did you call , my lord ?
Sirs , I ask you to sleep in my tent .
I might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother Cassius .
If you like , we'll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
Look , Lucius , here's the book I was searching for .
I put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
I was sure that you hadn't given it to me .
Can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute ?
Yes , my lord , if you would like .
I would , my boy .
I ask too much of you , but you're always willing .
It's my duty , sir .
I shouldn't make you do more than you're able .
I know that young men look forward to their rest .
I've already slept , my lord .
That was good planning , and you'll sleep some more .
I won't keep you very long .
If I live through this , I'll be good to you .
This is a sleepy tune .
Gentle boy , good night .
I won't trouble you so much as to wake you .
Good night , good boy .
Let me see , let me see .
Didn't I turn down the page where I left off reading ?
Here it is , I think .
I think it's my bad eyesight that's making me see this horrible vision .
It's coming toward me .
Are you a god , an angel , or a devil , that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
Tell me what you are .
I'm your evil spirit , Brutus .
Why do you come here ?
To tell you that you'll see me at Philippi .
Then I'll see you again ?
Yes , at Philippi .
Alright , then I'll see you at Philippi .
Evil spirit , I want to talk some more .
Claudio !
Claudio !
He thinks he's still playing his instrument .
Lucius , wake up !
My lord ?
Were you dreaming , Lucius ?
My lord , I don't think I cried out .
Yes , you did .
Did you see anything ?
Nothing , my lord .
My lord ?
My lord ?
Why did you cry out in your sleep ?
Did we , my lord ?
Yes .
Did you see anything ?
No , my lord , I didn't see anything .
Me neither , my lord .
Go to my brother Cassius .
Order him to advance his forces first thing , and we'll follow .
Yes , my lord .
Now , Antony , our prayers have been answered .
You said the enemy wouldn't come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
It seems not .
Their forces are nearby .
They intend to challenge us here at Philippi , responding to our challenge before we've even challenged him .
I know how they think , and I understand why they're doing this .
They really wish they were somewhere else , but they want to descend on us , looking fierce so we'll think they're brave .
But they aren't .
Prepare yourselves , generals .
The enemy approaches with great display .
They show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
Octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
I'll go to the right side .
You stay on the left .
Why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
They want to talk .
Stay here , Titinius .
We have to go out and talk to them .
Mark Antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
No , Octavius Caesar , we'll respond to their charge .
Go forward .
The generals want to speak with us .
Words before fighting .
Is that how it is , countrymen ?
Not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
Good words are better than bad strokes , Octavius .
Brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
But your words are as sweet as honey , you've stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
I took their stings too , wouldn't you say ?
Villains , you didn't do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up Caesar's sides .
Now , Brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
Come , come , let's remember why we're here .
If arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
Caesar , you're not going to be killed by a traitor , unless you kill yourself..
I hope you're right .
I wasn't born to die on your sword .
If you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn't die more honorably .
An annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
Still the same old Cassius !
If you dare to fight today , come to the field .
If not , come when you have the courage .
Now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
The storm has begun and everything is at stake .
Messala !
Messala , today is my birthday , I was born on this very day .
Give me your hand , Messala .
You'll be my witness that I've been forced , as Pompey was , to wager all of our freedoms on one battle .
You know that I used to believe in Epicurus and his disregard for omens .
I've changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
Traveling from Sardis , two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there , eating from the hands of the soldiers who'd accompanied us to Philippi .
This morning , they've flown away and in their place are ravens , crows , and kites , flying over our heads and looking down on us , as though we were sickly prey .
Their shadows are like a deadly canopy , under which our army lies , ready to die .
Don't believe in this .
I only partly believe it , for I'm enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
Now , most noble Brutus , the gods are friendly with us today so that we , who want peace , can live on to old age !
But since the affairs of men are always uncertain , let's think about the worst that may happen .
If we lose this battle , this is the last time we'll speak to each other .
If we lose , what do you plan to do ?
Cast spells with them , and "Brutus" will call up a ghost as well as "Caesar." Now , in the name of all the gods , I ask you what food does Caesar eat that has made him grow so great ?
Our era should be ashamed !
Rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
When was there ever an age , since the beginning of time , that didn't feature more than one famous man ?
Until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast Rome .
Now , though , in all of Rome , there's room for only one man .
You and I have heard our fathers talk of another Brutus , your ancestor , who would've let the devil himself reign in his Roman Republic before he let a king rule .
I have no doubt that you love me .
I'm beginning to understand what you want me to do .
What I think about this , and about what's happening here in Rome , I'll tell you later .
For now , don't try to persuade me anymore , I ask you as a friend .
I'll think over what you've said , I'll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say , and I'll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
Until then , my noble friend , think about this : I'd rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of Rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through .
I'm glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
Then if we lose this battle , you'll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of Rome ?
No , Cassius , no .
Don't imagine that I'll ever allow myself to return to Rome in chains .
My mind is too great for that .
Therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
Forever and forever , farewell , Cassius !
If we meet again , then we'll smile .
If not , then this parting was well done .
Forever and forever , farewell , Brutus !
If we meet again , then we'll smile indeed .
If not , it's true , this parting was well done .
Well , lead on .
Oh , I wish I could know what will happen today before it happens !
But it's enough to know that the day will end , and then the end will be known .
Let's go !
Ride , ride , Messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
They should advance immediately , because I sense Octavius's side is a bit fainthearted right now , and a sudden push would overthrow him .
Ride , ride , Messala .
I've become an enemy to my own soldiers !
Oh , Cassius , Brutus gave the orders too soon .
Retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
Mark Antony is in your tents , my lord .
Therefore you must run , noble Cassius .
Are those my tents on fire ?
They are , my lord .
Titinius , if you love me , get on your horse and spur him on until he's brought you to those troops and back again , so that I can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies .
I'll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
Go , Pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
My eyesight has always been bad .
Watch Titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
Today was the day I breathed my first breath .
Time has come round , and I'll end where I began .
My life has run its circle .
What news ?
And listen !
They shout for joy .
Come down , look no more .
Oh , I'm such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
Come here , boy .
Come now , keep your oath .
Caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
So I'm free .
But I didn't want to be free like this .
Oh , Cassius , I'll run far from this country to where no Romans can find me .
The armies have merely changed places , Titinius , because Octavius has been overthrown by noble Brutus's forces at the very moment that Antony overthrew Cassius's legions .
This news will comfort Cassius .
Where did you leave him ?
On this hill and in despair , with his slave Pindarus .
Isn't that him on the ground ?
He doesn't seem to be alive .
Oh , my heart !
Isn't that him ?
Pindarus !
Where are you , Pindarus ?
Look for him , Titinius , while I go to meet the noble Brutus and force him to hear this news .
I say "force" because Brutus would rather I stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this .
Hurry , Messala , and I'll look for Pindarus in the meantime .
Why did you send me out , brave Cassius ?
Didn't I meet up with your allies ?
And didn't they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you ?
Didn't you hear their shouts ?
Alas , you misunderstood everything !
But let me place this wreath on your head .
Your Brutus ordered me to give it to you , and I'll do what he says .
Where is his body , Messala ?
Over there , where Titinius mourns it .
Titinius is lying face-up .
He's been killed .
Oh , Julius Caesar , you are still powerful .
Your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
Could you have found two Romans as good as these two ?
Good-bye to you , the last of all the Romans .
I will find the time to cry for you , Cassius , I'll find the time .
Come , then , and send his body to Thasos .
Let's proceed to the field .
Labio and Flavio , push our armies onward .
It is three o'clock , and , Romans , before night , we will try our luck in a second battle .
Who is so low that he wouldn't ?
Who will advance with me ?
I will proclaim my name around the field .
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
An enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
I am the son of Marcus Cato !
And I am Brutus , Marcus Brutus .
Brutus , my country's friend .
Know that I am Brutus !
Oh , young and noble Cato , have you been slain ?
I'd rather die .
Here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
Kill Brutus and be honored by the killing .
We must not .
He is a noble prisoner !
Make room !
Tell Antony that Brutus has been taken .
I'll tell him the news .
Where is he ?
He's safe , Antony .
I can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble Brutus alive .
The gods protect him from so great a shame !
The games are done and Caesar is returning .
As they pass by , grab Casca by the sleeve , and he'll tell you if anything important happened today , in his usual sour way .
I'll do so .
But look , Cassius , Caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they've been scolded .
Calphurnia's face is pale , and Cicero's eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the Capitol .
Casca will tell us what's the matter .
Antonio !
Caesar ?
Come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
Statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn't come back .
He's been captured or killed .
Sit down , Clitus .
Listen , Clitus .
Who , me , my lord ?
No , not for all the world .
Silence , then !
Don't give it away .
I'd rather kill myself .
Listen , Dardanius .
Would I dare do something like that ?
Oh Dardanius !
Oh Clitus !
Come here , good Volumnius .
Listen a minute .
What is it , my lord ?
Once at Sardis and once last night , here in Philippi fields .
I know that my hour has come .
No , it hasn't , my lord .
No , I'm sure it has , Volumnius .
You see how the world goes , Volumnius .
Our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
It's nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
Good Volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
For the sake of our old friendship , I ask you , hold my sword handle while I run on it .
That's not a job for a friend , my lord .
Run , run , my lord .
We can't wait here .
Farewell to you , and you , and you , Volumnius .
Strato , you've slept this whole time .
I'll have glory in this losing day , more than Octavius and Mark Antony will gain by their foul conquest .
So farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
I can't see ahead of me .
My bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
Run , my lord , run .
Go on !
I'll follow .
I beg you , Strato , stay by me .
You're a man with a good reputation .
Your life has had honor in it .
Then , hold my sword and turn your face away while I run on it .
Will you , Strato ?
Give me your hand , first .
Farewell , good Strato .
What man is that ?
Free from the bondage you are in , Messala .
I'll take all who served Brutus into my service .
You , will you join with me ?
Yes , if Messala recommends me to you .
Do so , good Messala .
How did my master die , Strato ?
I held the sword and he ran on it .
Then take this man into your service , Octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
This was the noblest Roman of them all .
All the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great Caesar .
Only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
His life was gentle , and the elements mixed so well in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world , "This was a man." Let's treat him according to his virtue , with all the respect and rituals of burial .
His body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
So order the armies to rest , and let's go home to share the glories of this happy day .
Yes , Casca .
Tell us what happened today that put Caesar in such a serious mood .
But you were with him , weren't you ?
If I were , I wouldn't need to ask you what happened .
A crown was offered to him , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this , and then the people started shouting .
What was the second noise for ?
The same thing .
They shouted three times .
What was the last cry for ?
For the same thing .
The crown was offered to him three times ?
Yes , indeed , it was , and he pushed it away three times , each time more gently than the last ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted .
Who offered him the crown ?
Antony .
Tell us how it happened , noble Casca .
I can't explain it .
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown , though it wasn't a real crown , just a small circlet , and , as I told you , he refused it once , though in my opinion he would've liked to have it .
Then Antony offered it to him again , and he refused it again ( though , in my opinion , he was reluctant to take his hand off it ) .
Then Antony offered it the third time .
As for myself , I didn't dare laugh , for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air .
But wait a minute , please .
Did you say Caesar fainted ?
He fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
That's very likely .
He has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
No , Caesar doesn't have epilepsy .
You and I , and honest Casca , we have epilepsy , we've fallen .
I don't know what you mean by that , but I'm sure Caesar fell down .
What did he say when he regained consciousness ?
Indeed , before he fell down , when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown , he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
If I'd been a common laborer and hadn't taken him up on his offer , to hell with me .
And so he fainted .
When he regained consciousness again , he said that if he'd done or said anything wrong , he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .
Three or four women near me cried , "Alas , good soul ! " and forgave him with all their hearts .
But never mind them , if Caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would've forgiven him .
And after that he came back here looking so serious ?
Yes .
Get out of here !
Go home , you lazy men .
What , is today a holiday ?
I'm a carpenter , sir .
Where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
What are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
And you , sir , what's Well , compared to a fine workman , you might call me a mere cobbler .
But what's your trade ?
Answer me straightforwardly .
It is a trade , sir , that I practice with a clear conscience .
What trade , boy ?
You insolent rascal , what trade ?
Sir , please , don't be angry .
But if your soles are worn out , I can mend you .
What do you mean by that ?
Mend" me , you impertinent fellow ?
Did Cicero say anything ?
Yes , he said something in Greek .
What did he say ?
If I told you I understood Greek , I'd be lying .
But those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
As for myself , it was Greek to me .
I have more news too .
Murellus and Flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of Caesar .
There you go .
There was even more foolishness , if I could only remember it .
Will you have dinner with me tonight , Casca ?
No , I have a commitment .
Will you dine with me tomorrow ?
Yes , if I'm still alive , and you're still sane , and your dinner is worth eating .
Good .
I'll expect you .
Do so .
Farewell to you both .
What a stupid man he's become !
He was so sharp when he was in school .
He's still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise , though he puts on this show of stupidity .
He speaks roughly , but what he says is smart , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him .
You're right , that's how it is .
I'll leave you for now .
If you'd like to talk tomorrow , I'll come to your home .
Or , if you don't mind , come to my home , and I'll wait for you .
I'll do so .
Until then , think about the well-being of Rome .
Well , Brutus , you're noble .
Caesar resents me , but he loves Brutus .
If I were Brutus now and Brutus were me , I wouldn't have let him influence me .
Tonight I'll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting , as if they came from several citizens , all testifying to the great respect Romans have for Brutus , and all alluding to Caesar's unseemly ambition .
Did you accompany Caesar home ?
Cicero , I've seen storms in which the angry winds split old oak trees , and I've seen the ocean swell , rage , and foam , as if it wanted to reach the storm clouds , but never before tonight , never until now , have I experienced a storm that drops fire .
Either there are wars in heaven , or else the world , too insolent toward the gods , provokes them to send destruction .
Also , I've kept my sword unsheathed since I saw this , in front of the Capitol I met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me .
And there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets .
And yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
When all these extraordinary things happen at once , we shouldn't say , "These happenings can be explained rationally .
They're natural enough." I think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
Indeed , it's a strange time .
But men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
Is Caesar visiting the Capitol tomorrow ?
He is , because he told Antonius to tell you he'd be there tomorrow .
Good night then , Casca .
This bad weather isn't good to walk around in .
A Roman .
It's Casca , I know your voice .
Your ear is good .
Cassius , what a night this is !
It's a very pleasing night to honest men .
Who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
Those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
I have walked around the streets , exposing myself to the perilous night , unbuttoned like this , as you see , Casca , baring my chest to the thunderbolt .
When the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky , I put myself right where I thought it would hit .
But why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
Mankind's role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
You're acting stupid , Casca , and you lack the quick wits that a Roman should have , or else you don't use them .
You go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
A man no mightier than you or I in ability , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight's strange happenings .
Let it be who it is .
Our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
Indeed , they say that the senators plan to establish Caesar as a king tomorrow , and he'll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in Italy .
I know where I'll wear this dagger , then .
I'll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
In suicide , gods make the weak strong .
In suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
No stony tower , no brass walls , no airless dungeon , no iron chains can contain a strong mind .
But if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
Let everyone beware : I can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever I choose .
So can I .
In fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
How can Caesar be a tyrant then ?
Poor man !
I know he wouldn't be a wolf if the Romans didn't act like sheep .
He couldn't be a lion if the Romans weren't such easy prey .
People who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
But , oh no !
What have I said in my grief ?
Say no more .
Shake my hand .
If you're joining together to right these wrongs , I'll go as far as any one of you .
That's a deal .
Now let me tell you , Casca , I have already convinced some of the noblest Romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission .
And I know that by now they're waiting for me on the porch outside Pompey's theater .
It's Cinna .
I recognize his walk .
To find you .
Who's that ?
Metellus Cimber ?
No , it's Casca , someone who's going to work with us .
Aren't the others waiting for me , Cinna ?
I'm glad Casca is with us .
What a fearful night this is !
Two or three of us have seen strange things .
Are the others waiting ?
Tell me .
Yes , they are .
Oh , Cassius , if you could only convince Brutus to join us , Don't worry .
Good Cinna , take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge's chair where Brutus sits , so he'll find it .
When you've finished all this , return to the porch of Pompey's theater , where you'll find us .
Are Decius Brutus and Trebonius there ?
Everyone's there except Metellus Cimber , and he's gone to look for you at your house .
Well , I'll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
When you've finished , go back to Pompey's theater .
Come on , Casca , you and I will go see Brutus at his house before sunrise .
Yes , you're absolutely right about how worthy Brutus is and how much we need him .
Let's go , because it's already after midnight , and we want him on our side before daylight .
Wake up , I say !
Lucius !
Did you call me , my lord ?
Put a candle in my study , Lucius .
Call me when it's lit .
I will , my lord .
I have no personal reason to strike at him , only the best interest of the people .
He wants to be crowned .
The question is , how would being king change him ?
Evil can come from good , just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days , which means we have to walk carefully .
If we crown him , I have to admit we'd be giving him the power to do damage .
Cobble you , sir .
You're a cobbler , are you ?
Sir , I make my living using an awl .
I'm a surgeon to old shoes .
When they're endangered , I save them .
The noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
But why aren't you in your shop today ?
Why are you leading these men through the streets ?
Well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
Why would you celebrate it ?
What victory does he bring home ?
What foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
Rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
Caesar might act like that .
Therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
And since our quarrel is with his future behavior , not what he does now , I must frame the argument like this : if his position is furthered , his character will fulfill these predictions .
The candle is burning in your study , sir .
While I was looking for a flint to light it , I found this paper on the window , sealed up like this , and I'm sure it wasn't there when I went to bed .
Go back to bed .
It isn't daybreak yet .
Is tomorrow the 15th of March , boy ?
I don't know , sir .
Check the calendar and come tell me .
I will , sir .
Sir , fifteen days of March have gone by .
Good .
Go to the gate .
Somebody's knocking .
I haven't slept since Cassius first began to turn me against Caesar .
Is he alone ?
Do you know them ?
Let them in .
Oh , conspiracy , are you ashamed to show your face even at night , when evil things are most free ?
If so , when it's day , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
Instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
I'm afraid we're intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
Good morning , Brutus .
Are we bothering you ?
I've been up all night .
Do I know these men who are with you ?
This is Trebonius .
He's welcome here .
This is Decius Brutus .
He's welcome too .
This is Casca .
This is Cinna .
And this is Metellus Cimber .
They're all welcome .
What worries have kept you awake tonight ?
Can I have a word with you ?
Here's the east .
Won't the dawn come from here ?
No .
You're both wrong .
And let us swear to our resolution .
No , let's not swear an oath .
Then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
But if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave , and I think we do , then , countrymen , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action ?
What bond do we need other than that of discreet Romans who have said what they're going to do and won't back down ?
And what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying ?
Swearing is for priests , cowards , overly cautious men , feeble old people , and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .
Only men whom you wouldn't trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
Don't spoil the justness and virtue of our endeavor nor weaken our own irrepressible spirits by thinking that we need a binding oath , when the blood that every noble Roman contains within him would be proven bastard's blood if he broke the smallest part of any promise he had made .
But what about Cicero ?
Should we see what he thinks ?
I think he will stand strong with us .
Let's not leave him out .
No , by no means .
Yes , we should get his support , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions .
They'll assume that Cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
No , don't even mention him .
He'll never follow anything that other men have started .
Then leave him out .
Indeed , he's not right for this .
Good point , Decius .
I don't think it would be wise to let Mark Antony , whom Caesar is so fond of , outlive Caesar .
We'd find that he was a dangerous plotter .
And as you know , his connections , if he put them to good use , might be enough to hurt us all .
Our action will seem too bloody if we cut off Caesar's head and then hack at his arms and legs too , Caius Cassius , because Mark Antony is merely one of Caesar's arms .
Let's be sacrificers but not butchers , Caius .
We're all against what Caesar stands for , and there's no blood in that .
Oh , how I wish we could oppose Caesar's spirit , his overblown ambition , and not hack up Caesar himself !
But , unfortunately , Caesar has to bleed if we're going to stop him .
Noble friends , let's kill him boldly but not with anger .
Let's carve him up like a dish fit for the gods , not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs .
Let's be angry only long enough to do the deed , and then let's act like we're disgusted by what we had to do .
This will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
If he loves Caesar , then he can only hurt himself , by grieving and dying for Caesar .
And I'd be surprised if he even did that , for he prefers sports , fun , and friends .
There's nothing to fear in him .
Quiet !
Count how many times the clock chimes .
The clock struck three .
It's time to leave .
It might happen that these strange signs , the unusual terror of this night , and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the Capitol today .
Don't worry about that .
If he's reluctant , I can convince him .
He loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers , just like unicorns can be captured in trees , elephants in holes , and lions with nets .
When I tell him he hates flatterers , he agrees , just at the moment when I'm flattering him the most .
Let me work on him .
I can put him in the right mood , and I'll bring him to the Capitol .
No , we'll all go there to bring him .
By eight o'clock .
Is that the latest we can do it ?
Caius Ligarius doesn't like Caesar , who berated him for speaking well of Pompey .
I wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
Good Metellus , go to him now .
He likes me , and I've given him good reason to .
Just send him here , and I'll persuade him .
The morning is approaching .
We'll leave , Brutus .
Friends , go your separate ways .
But all of you , remember what you've said and prove yourselves true Romans .
Good gentlemen , look like you're rested and happy .
And so , good morning to all of you .
Boy !
Lucius !
Fast asleep ?
Well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
That's why you sleep so soundly .
Brutus , my lord .
Portia , what are you doing awake ?
It isn't good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
It's not good for your health , either .
You rudely snuck out of bed .
And last night at dinner , you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed , brooding and sighing , and when I asked you what was the matter , you gave me a dirty look .
I asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
I still insisted on knowing what the matter was , but you wouldn't answer me , instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone .
My dear lord , tell me what's bothering you .
And now you toss flowers in the path of Caesar , who comes in triumph over Pompey's defeated sons ?
Go home !
Run to your houses , fall on your knees , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude .
Go , go , good countrymen , and to make up for having done wrong , gather up all the poor men like yourselves , lead them to the Tiber , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks .
You go down toward the Capitol , and I'll go this way .
Undress the statues if they're decorated in honor of Caesar .
Can we do that ?
I'll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
You do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
If we take away Caesar's support , he'll have to come back down to earth ; otherwise , he'll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience .
I'm not feeling well , that's all .
You're smart , though , and if you were sick , you'd take what you needed to get better .
I'm doing so .
Good Portia , go to bed .
Are you sick ?
And is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
You're sick , yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker ?
Don't kneel , noble Portia .
You're my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .
If that were true , then I'd know your secret .
I admit I'm only a woman , but nevertheless I'm the woman Lord Brutus took for his wife .
I admit I'm only a woman , but I'm still a woman from a noble family , I'm Cato's daughter .
Do you really think I'm no stronger than the rest of my sex , with such a father and such a husband ?
Tell me your secrets .
I won't betray them .
I've proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
If I can bear that pain , then I can bear my husband's secrets .
Oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
Listen !
Someone knocks .
Leave me quickly .
Lucius , who's that knocking ?
Here's a sick man who wants to speak with you .
How I wish you felt better !
I'm not sick if you've prepared some honorable exploit for me .
Indeed , I would have such an exploit for you , Ligarius , if you were healthy enough to hear it .
A deed that will make sick men healthy .
But aren't there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
That too .
My dear Caius , I'll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .
Follow me , then .
Neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
Calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , "Help , someone !
They're murdering Caesar ! " Who's there ?
My lord ?
Go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
I will , my lord .
What are you doing , Caesar ?
Are you planning to go out ?
You're not leaving the house today .
I will go out .
The things that threaten me have only seen my back .
When they see the face of Caesar , they will vanish .
Caesar , I never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
A servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too , but different ones from what we heard and saw .
A lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
Fierce , fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war , ranks and squadrons , until the clouds drizzled blood onto the Capitol .
Oh , Caesar !
These things are beyond anything we've seen before , and I'm afraid .
How can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
But I will go out , for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me .
When beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
The heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
Cowards die many times before their deaths .
The brave experience death only once .
Of all the strange things I've ever heard , it seems most strange to me that men fear death , given that death , which can't be avoided , will come whenever it wants .
What do the priests say ?
They don't want you to go out today .
They pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn't find its heart .
The gods do this to test my bravery .
They're saying I'd be an animal without a heart if I stayed home today out of fear .
So , I won't .
We're two lions born on the same day in the same litter , and I'm the older and more terrible .
I will go out .
Alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
Don't go out today .
Say that it's my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .
We'll send Mark Antony to the senate house , and he'll say that you're sick today .
Mark Antony will say I'm not well , and to please you I'll stay at home .
Here's Decius Brutus .
He'll tell them so .
Hail , Caesar !
Good morning , worthy Caesar .
I've come to take you to the senate house .
And you've come at a good time , so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them I won't come today .
Would I send a lie ?
Have I accomplished so much in battle , but now I'm afraid to tell some old men the truth ?
Decius , go tell them that Caesar won't come .
Most mighty Caesar , give me some reason , so I won't be laughed at when I tell them so .
The reason is that it's what I want .
I'm not coming .
That's enough for the senate .
But for your private satisfaction , because I love you , I'll tell you .
Calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
She takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come , and , on her knee , she begged me to stay home today .
This dream has been interpreted all wrong .
It was a good and lucky vision .
Your statue spouting blood through many holes , in which many smiling Romans bathed , means that you'll provide great Rome with sustaining blood , and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood .
This is what Calphurnia's dream means .
You've offered an excellent interpretation .
I will have when you hear the rest of what I have to say .
The senate has decided to give mighty Caesar a crown today .
If you send them word that you won't come , they might change their minds .
How foolish your fears seem now , Calphurnia !
I'm ashamed that I yielded to them .
Give me my robe , because I'm going .
And look , here's Publius , come to fetch me .
Good morning , Caesar .
Welcome , Publius .
Caius Ligarius , I was never your enemy so much as the sickness that's made you so thin .
What time is it ?
Caesar , the clock has struck eight .
I thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
And to you , most noble Caesar .
I'm to blame for making you wait for me .
Trebonius !
Remember to see me today .
Stay near me so I'll remember .
Caesar , I will .
Good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
And we'll leave together , like friends .
Calphurnia !
Quiet !
Caesar's talking .
Calphurnia !
I'm here , my lord .
Yes , Caesar ?
I'll remember .
When Caesar says "do this , " it is done .
Continue , then , and don't forget to perform all of the rituals .
Caesar !
Caesar , beware of Brutus .
Watch Cassius .
Don't go near Casca .
Keep an eye on Cinna .
Don't trust Trebonius .
Pay attention to Metellus Cimber .
Decius Brutus doesn't love you .
You've wronged Caius Ligarius .
These men all have one intention , and it's directed against Caesar .
If you aren't immortal , watch those around you .
A sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
I pray that the mighty gods defend you !
Your friend , Artemidorus." I'll stand here until Caesar passes by , and I'll give him this as though it's a petition .
If you read this , Caesar , you might live .
If not , the Fates are on the side of the traitors .
Boy , I beg you to run to the senate house .
Don't stay to answer me , get going .
I want you there and back again before I can even tell you what you should do there .
Madam , what should I do ?
Run to the Capitol and nothing else ?
And then return to you and nothing else ?
Yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
And pay attention to what Caesar does and which men are close to him .
Listen , boy !
What's that noise ?
I don't hear anything , madam .
I beg you , listen well .
Truly , madam , I don't hear anything .
Come here , you .
Where are you coming from ?
My own house , good lady .
What time is it ?
Around nine o'clock , madam .
Has Caesar gone to the Capital yet ?
Madam , not yet .
I'm going to stand so I can see him pass on the way to the Capitol .
You have some plea for Caesar , don't you ?
Yes , I do , lady .
If it pleases Caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me , I'll try to get him to do what's good for him .
Why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
Nothing that I know for sure , but a lot that I'm afraid might happen .
Good morning to you .
The street is narrow here .
The crowd that follows Caesar at his heels , senators , justices , common petitioners , will suffocate a feeble man almost to death .
I'll move to a more open place and there speak to great Caesar as he walks past .
I must go in .
Yes , Caesar , but it's not gone yet .
Oh , Caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
Read it , great Caesar .
Whatever pertains to myself I will deal with last .
Don't delay , Caesar .
Read it instantly .
What , is the man insane ?
You have weapons ?
What's going on here ?
Stop it , I order you .
The next person to strike again dies .
What's going on here ?
These are the messengers from my sister and the king .
What are you fighting about ?
Tell me .
I'm out of breath , sir .
A tailor made you .
That's an odd thing to say .
How can a tailor make a person ?
Definitely a tailor , sir .
A sculptor or a painter couldn't have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice .
But tell me what you're fighting about .
Calm down .
Don't you have any manners , you savage ?
Yes , sir , but not when I'm enraged .
Why are you enraged ?
Are you laughing at what I say , as if I were a fool ?
Are you insane , old man ?
Why are you calling him a jerk ?
What did he do to you ?
I don't like his face .
But maybe you don't like mine , or his , or hers either .
This is a guy who's been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words .
No flattery for him , no sir !
He's honest , he's got to speak the truth .
If people take what he says , fine .
If not , he's got truth on his side !
Dearest , kindest , most honorable sir , may I say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god Phoebus , that , What do you mean by that ?
I tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
Sir , I know I'm not a flatterer .
I never offended him at all .
These cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
Don't put me in the stocks .
I serve the king , who sent me here .
If you put me in the stocks you'll insult him both as a king and as a man .
Bring out the stocks !
I swear on my life and honor , he'll sit here in the stocks until noon .
Only until noon , my lord ?
No , the whole day , and all night too .
Ma'am , you wouldn't treat me like this if I were your father's dog .
But since you're his scoundrel servant , I will .
This guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about. , Come on , bring in the stocks , now !
I beg you not to do this , my lord .
He's done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
The king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
I'll take responsibility for that .
My sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders. , Put his legs in the stocks .
I'm sorry , my friend .
I'll try talking to him again .
Please don't , sir .
Even good men have bad luck .
Have a good morning .
It's wrong for the duke to do this .
The king will be angry with him .
honor you .
Hopefully when I get married , I'll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .
I'm sure I'll never get married in the way my sisters say they're married , loving their father only .
But do you mean what you're saying ?
Yes , my lord .
So young and so cruel ?
So young , my lord , and honest .
Then that's the way it'll be .
The truth will be all the inheritance you get .
Foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex-daughter of mine .
But sir , Be quiet , Kent .
I heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
Every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
I'll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing .
Well , at least that's something .
As Edgar , I'm nothing at all .
It's strange that Regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
According to what I heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
What's this ?
Are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
No , my lord .
Ha , ha !
That's a nasty garter belt .
You tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs .
Your daughter and son-in-law .
No .
Yes .
No , no , they wouldn't .
Yes , they have .
By the god Jupiter above , I swear "No." By Jupiter's wife Juno , I swear "Yes." They wouldn't dare .
They couldn't , they wouldn't .
It's worse than murder to humiliate a king's messenger like this .
My lord , when I arrived at their home I gave them your letter .
He woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
That's why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
Fathers who wear rags Make their children neglect them .
But fathers who are rich Make their children kind .
Lady Luck is a fickle whore And never gives the poor a break .
But despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money , or do I mean pain ? , in the coming year .
I feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
Inside , sir , with the earl .
Don't follow me .
Stay here .
You didn't do anything else to earn this punishment ?
Nothing .
Tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
If they'd put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would've deserved it .
Why , Fool ?
You need to learn what ants know well about winter , there's no point in slaving away if there's no hope for profit .
Everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
When you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you shouldn't try to hold on to it or it'll break your neck .
But if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
And when a wise man gives you better advice than I just did , give me my advice back again .
I only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
The gentleman who serves you only for profit And is only superficially loyal to you Will take off when it starts to rain And leave you alone in the storm .
But I'll linger .
The fool will stay .
And let the wise man run away .
Where did you learn that song , Fool ?
Not in the stocks , fool .
How can they refuse to speak with me ?
They're playing with me .
These are tricks .
This is rebellion .
My dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
Damn it all to hell !
Passionately" ?
What "passion" ?
Gloucester , Gloucester , I want to speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife .
My lord , I informed them as much .
Informed them" ?
Do you understand what I'm saying , man ?
Yes , my lord .
The king wants to speak with Cornwall .
Did you inform them of that ?
This is unbelievable !
Passionate" ?
The "passionate" duke ?
Tell the hot-headed duke that I, But no , not yet .
Maybe he's not feeling well .
I just want everything to be all right between you .
Oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
Stay down , heart .
That's right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the Good morning to you both .
Hail to your majesty .
I'm glad to see your highness .
I believe you are , Regan .
You know why I think so ?
My dear Regan , your sister's not worth anything .
Oh , Regan , she's torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
Calm down , sir , please .
How do you mean ?
I can't believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
If she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you can't blame her for it .
I curse her .
Sir , you're old .
Your life is stretched to its limit .
You should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what's good for you .
Please go back to Goneril's house .
Admit you were wrong .
Apologize ?
No more , please .
These are ugly antics .
Go back to my sister's .
Shush , sir , please !
I hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
I hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
Oh , dear gods !
That's how you'll talk about me when you're in this mood .
Her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
You haven't forgotten the half of a kingdom I gave you .
Sir , let's get to the point .
Get out of my sight ! , I guess if she doesn't love her father , then I'll only have peace when I'm dead. , Call the King of France .
Call the Duke of Burgundy .
If she wants to be proud , or "honest , " as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride .
King Lear , I've always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers , I'm furious and ready to snap .
Let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
Kent can speak rudely when Lear goes mad .
What are you doing , old man ?
When powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
When a majestic king starts acting silly , then it's my duty to be blunt .
What's that trumpet ?
I know it .
She'll be here soon , just like her letter said .
This is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for. , Get out of my sight , scoundrel !
What do you mean , your highness ?
Who put my servant in the stocks ?
Regan , I hope you didn't know anything about that. , Ah , who's this ?
Why shouldn't she take my hand , father ?
How exactly have I offended you ?
I sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment .
You !
You did it ?
Please , father , since you're weak , act like it .
Get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
Right now I'm away from home and I can't provide you with proper care .
Go back with her ?
Go back with her ?
I might as well go before the King of France , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive .
Go back with her ?
I'd rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
As you wish , sir .
I beg you , daughter , don't make me crazy .
I won't bother you .
We'll never see each other again .
But you're still my child , my flesh and blood , or rather you're a disease in my flesh , a disease I still have to call my own .
You're a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
But I'll stop rebuking you .
I won't beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
Become a better
person when you're ready , if you're inclined .
I'll wait patiently .
Meanwhile I'll stay with Regan with my hundred knights .
It's not quite that simple .
I wasn't expecting you , and I'm not ready to receive you .
Please hear what Goneril is saying .
We're trying to be reasonable while you're so upset , and we understand that you're old , and, But Goneril knows what she's doing .
Yes , I do .
How could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
It would be hard , almost impossible .
Why couldn't you be attended by my servants , or by Regan's ?
Yes , why not , my lord ?
Then if they're negligent , we could control them .
Now that I think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you .
I won't lodge any more than that under my roof .
I gave you everything , And it was about time too .
I made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that I could keep a hundred knights of my own .
Why should I now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
Regan , is that what you said ?
Yes , I'll say it again , my lord .
No more than twenty-five .
Not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , I guess .
Hear me out , my lord .
Why do you need twenty-five knights , or ten , or even five , when you're staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
Why do you need even one ?
Oh , don't ask me why I "need" them !
You're a well-dressed lady .
If you dressed only to stay warm , you wouldn't need these gorgeous clothes you're wearing , which don't keep you warm at all .
Oh , gods , give me patience !
You see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age .
If you're the ones setting my daughters against me , don't let me be foolish enough to take it lying down .
man's cheeks .
No , you monstrous hags , I'll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world, I will do such things , I don't know what I'll do exactly , but it'll be devastating .
You expect me to cry ?
Well , I won't .
I have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before I let myself cry. , Oh , Fool , I'll go mad !
Let's go inside .
There's going to be a storm .
This is a small house .
There's no room for the old man and his followers .
It's his fault that he's all worked up like this .
He has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
That's what I intend to do too .
Where is Gloucester ?
He followed the old man .
Here he comes back .
Where's he going ?
He has called for his horse , but I don't know where he's headed .
It's best just to let him go .
He won't listen to anyone's advice .
There's hardly a bush for miles around .
Oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
Lock the doors .
His attendants are desperate , violent men .
I'm afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he's in .
Lock the doors , my lord .
It's a wild night .
Regan gives good advice .
Come in out of the storm .
Who's there , aside from this foul weather ?
Someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
I know you .
Where's the king ?
Struggling with the wind and rain .
He's shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth , he wants to see the world return to primal chaos .
He keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness .
Small but brave in his surroundings , he's trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth .
He's running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide .
But who's with him ?
Nobody but the fool , who's trying to soothe the wounds in the king's heart with jokes .
Sir , I know you , and I trust you enough to share something very important with you .
Some French agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war .
Now this is where you come in .
I'm a nobleman , and I know what I'm doing in assigning this job to you .
Let's discuss it some more .
Let me shake your hand .
Do you have anything else to tell me ?
Rage on , blow !
Let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
Let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
Let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow !
Oh , uncle , it's better to smile and flatter indoors where it's dry than get soaked out here .
Please , uncle , let's go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
This storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
Let thunder rumble !
Let lightning spit fire !
Let the rain spray !
The rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
Nature , I don't accuse your weather of unkindness .
So go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
Here I am , your slave , a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
Anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
On my life I swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn't love you least .
Kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
Get out of my sight !
Learn to see better , Lear , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .
Now , I swear by Apollo, By Apollo , King , you're taking the names of the gods in vain .
Oh , you lowlife !
Scum !
Please stop , sir .
Listen to me , you traitor .
For there never was a pretty woman who didn't like to preen in the mirror .
No , I'll be patient .
I won't say a word .
Who's there ?
A wise man and a fool .
Let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
It will give you some protection from this storm .
They are harder than the stones the house is made of .
I'm starting to lose my mind .
That's true , my good boy. , Come on , take us to that hut .
I'll recite a prophecy before I go .
And whoever lives to see that day Will walk with his feet .
This is the prophecy that the wizard
Oh , oh , Edmund , I don't like this monstrous business .
When asked the Duke and Duchess of Cornwall if I could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way .
That's uncivilized and unnatural !
Oh , be quiet .
There's a feud between the two dukes .
It's dangerous to talk about it .
I've locked it up in my room .
The humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
Armed forces have already landed .
We have to take the king's side .
I'll look for him and secretly help him .
You go and talk to the duke so he won't notice I'm helping the king .
If he asks to see me , tell him I'm sick and went to bed .
Even if I have to die , as they threaten , I have to help the king .
Strange things are about to happen , Edmund .
Please be careful .
And I'll tell him about the letter too .
The young generation rises while the old one falls .
Here's the hut , my lord .
Please go inside .
The night's too rough for humans to bear .
Leave me for a bit .
My lord , here is the entrance .
Will you break my heart ?
I'd rather break my own heart .
Now please go in .
You think it's a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
It's a big deal to you .
But whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
You would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you'd turn around and confront the bear .
When your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
But this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what's tormenting me , how ungrateful my children are !
Isn't their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
But I'll punish them thoroughly .
No , I won't cry any more .
Imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
But let it rain ; I'll survive .
On a night like this !
Oh , Regan , Goneril , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything , Oh , if I think about that I'll go mad .
I want to avoid that .
No more of these thoughts .
My lord , please go inside here .
Go inside yourself .
Make yourself comfortable .
This storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
But I'll go in .
Go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
Don't come in here , uncle !
There's a spirit in here !
Help me , help me !
Give me your hand .
Who's there ?
A ghost , a ghost !
He says his name's Poor Tom .
Who are you , moaning in the hut like that ?
Come out .
Go away !
The devil's after me !
The cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
Ha !
Get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
Did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
Bless your five senses !
Tom's chilly .
Oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
God protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
Take pity on Poor Tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
There ! , And over there ! , And over there !
Have his daughters made him crazy like this ? , Couldn't you have kept something for yourself ?
Did you have to give them everything ?
If he hadn't , we'd all be embarrassed to look at him .
Then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
He doesn't have any daughters , sir .
Like hell !
Nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
Is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
I'm the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
This stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
Beware of the devil .
Obey your parents , keep your word , don't swear , don't sleep with another man's wife , and don't covet flashy clothes .
Tom's chilly .
What were you before this ?
I loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a Turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
The cold wind's still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
Look at him .
The human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two-legged animal like you .
Let me unbutton this .
Please calm down , uncle .
This is a nasty night to go swimming .
On a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man , a tiny spark in a cold body .
Look , here comes a walking fire .
This is the devil Flibbertigibbet .
He gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
And go away , witch , go away .
How are you , your highness ?
Who are you ?
What do you want ?
Who are you ?
What are your names ?
Calm down , Smulkin , you fiend !
He's called Modo and Mahu .
Poor Tom's chilly .
Come back to my house with me .
I couldn't bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
They commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but I've come out here to find you and take you where there's warmth and food .
First let me talk with this philosopher here. ,
Now get out of here !
I swear by Jupiter I'll never revoke this punishment .
Farewell , King .
Here are the rulers of France and Burgundy , my lord .
My lord the ruler of Burgundy , I'll speak to you first .
You've been competing with this king for my daughter .
Let me ask you something in private .
Can you blame him ?
His daughters want to kill him .
Ah , good old Kent said this would happen , that poor , banished man .
You say the king is losing his mind .
Let me tell you , my friend , I'm almost insane myself .
I had a son , whom I've legally disowned .
He tried to kill me recently , very recently .
I loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
What a storm !
Excuse me , sir. , Tom's chilly .
Stay warm .
Come on , let's all go inside .
This way , my lord .
Come on , my dear Greek philosopher .
I'll get my revenge before I leave this house .
I'm afraid to think how I'll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you .
Now I realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .
How unlucky am I , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
Come with me to see the duchess .
If this letter's right , you've got a lot to deal with .
Right or not , it's made you the Earl of Gloucester .
I put my trust in you .
It's better here than outside .
Be happy about it .
I'll do what I can to make you even more comfortable .
I won't be gone long .
He can't bear his grief and so he's losing his mind .
May God reward you for your kindness !
He's a king , a king !
No , he's an ordinary guy who 's got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he's achieved that distinction himself .
I see Regan and Goneril in hell , A thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
The nasty devil's biting my butt .
I'll do it .
The devil sings like a nightingale to haunt Poor Tom .
The demon Hoppedance is in Tom's belly , crying for some fish to eat .
Stop whining , devil .
I've got no food to give you .
Let's have the evidence .
Let's give a fair verdict .
There she is .
Come here , ma'am .
Is your name Goneril ?
She can't deny it .
And here's Regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
Stop her !
Fire !
You corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
Bless your heart .
Look at the three little dogs , Tray , Blanch , and Sweetheart , all barking at me .
Tom will chase them off. , Go away , you mongrels !
Whether you bite to kill , Mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
Hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , Whether your tail is short or curly , Tom will make you cry and wail .
With one little toss of his head , He can scare you off for good .
Whether your mouth is black or white , Do-dee , dee-dee da .
Stop !
Run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
Poor Tom , your cup is empty .
Is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
Please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
Be quiet , be quiet .
Draw the curtains , just like that .
We'll have supper in the morning .
That's right .
And I'll go to bed at noon .
He's here , sir , but please don't bother him .
He's out of his right mind .
Please get him , my friend , I beg you .
Put
Carry your master out .
Come on , come on .
When we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery .
The person who suffers alone suffers the most .
Companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
Let's go , Tom .
Whatever else happens tonight , I hope the king escapes safely !
Lurk out of sight .
Hang him immediately .
Gouge out his eyes !
Leave him to my wrath. , Edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
You shouldn't have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
Tell the Duke of Albany to prepare for war immediately .
We will do the same .
We'll keep the lines of communication open between us .
Hello .
Where's the king ?
Lord Gloucester has helped him leave .
Thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they've set off for Dover , where they claim to have powerful friends .
Prepare the horses for your lady .
Goodbye , my sweet lord. , Goodbye , my sister .
Goodbye , Edmund .
Go find the traitor Gloucester .
Tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
That's him .
Tie up his withered old arms .
What are you doing ?
My friends , remember that you're my guests here .
Don't play any nasty tricks on me .
Tie him up , I tell you .
Your highness , I want nothing more than what you've already offered .
I know you'll offer nothing less than that .
There she is , over there .
I don't know what to say .
So do you take her or leave her ?
Then leave her , sir .
Tie him up harder. , You filthy traitor !
I'm not a traitor , unfair lady .
Tie him to this chair. , You'll see , criminal , By the gods , it's disgraceful for you to pull my beard .
As old and white-haired as you are , and you're such a traitor ?
Wicked woman , these white hairs you're pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing .
You are my guests .
This is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
What do you think you're doing ?
Tell us about the letters that you got from France .
Get to the point , since we already know the truth .
And what's your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
The ones you've sent our lunatic king to .
Tell us .
It came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
How clever of you .
Clever lies .
Where have you sent the king ?
To Dover .
Why Dover ?
Weren't you ordered , on penalty of , Why Dover ? , Let him answer that question first .
I'm backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
Why Dover ?
Because I didn't want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .
You left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars .
And the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
If wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would've told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world .
But soon I'll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
You won't be seeing anything. , Hold his chair still , men. , I'm going to put my foot on his eyes .
Oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
Oh , so cruel !
Oh dear gods !
Now he's a little crooked .
I've served you since childhood , but I've never done you a better service than telling you to stop .
What's this , you dog ?
I am willing to fight you if I must .
What do you mean by all this ?
Come on then .
I am dying ! , My lord , you still have one eye left to see Cornwall punished .
Oh !
Where's your sparkle now ?
Where's my son Edmund ?
Wrong , evil traitor .
You're appealing to a son who hates you .
He's too good to have any compassion for you .
What a fool I've been !
This means I've mistreated Edgar .
He can sniff his way to Dover .
I'm wounded .
Follow me , madam. , Throw the blind traitor outside .
And throw this dead peasant into the manure pit. , Regan , I'm bleeding .
It's a bad time for such an injury .
Give me your arm .
If our criminal master gets off free , I won't care what happens to me anymore .
If she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
Let's follow the old earl , and get that crazy Tom to take him wherever he wants to go .
As a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
Go ahead .
I'll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
Heaven help him !
At the bottom , any change is for the better .
So I welcome this wind freely .
But who is this ?
My father , led by a poor peasant ?
Oh , life is full of surprises !
We age and die because they wear us out .
I've rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
Away , get out of here .
Leave me , my friend .
But you can't see where you're going , sir .
I don't have anywhere to go , so I don't need to see .
When I could see , I didn't always see clearly .
It's often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous .
If I live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back .
Who's that ?
Who's there ?
Is it a beggar ?
I was reminded of my son , even though I despised my son at that time .
Now I know better .
Is that the naked guy ?
Yes , my lord .
But sir , he's crazy .
It's the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
Do as I asked you .
Or rather , do what you feel like doing .
Hey , naked guy , Poor Tom's chilly .
Come here , man .
Do you know the way to Dover ?
Poor Tom has been scared out of his mind .
Bless you , master .
Yes , sir .
There's a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
Take me to the edge of it , and I'll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
Once I'm there , I won't need a guide anymore .
Give me your arm .
Poor Tom will take you there .
Welcome , my lord .
I'm surprised my bland husband didn't meet me on the way here .
Where's your master ?
But it'd take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
Enough .
It would've been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did .
You mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and hasn't said everything she means to say and do ? , My lord of Burgundy , what do you have to say to this lady ?
Love's not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
Will you marry her ?
She herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
I'm at your service until death .
My dear Gloucester !
What a man ! , especially compared to my husband .
Edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
There's a fool sharing my bed now .
Ma'am , my master's coming .
So you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
Goneril , you aren't worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
I don't trust you .
You can't trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
She will wither and come to a bad end .
Oh , shut up .
Your words are idiotic .
Bad people can't appreciate wisdom or goodness .
They only like things as bad as themselves .
What have you two sisters done ?
You're tigers , not daughters .
Could my good brother-in-law , a man to whom the
Coward !
Shame on you , warped hag !
Your true demonic features are distorting your body .
If I let myself do what I yearn to , I'd rip the flesh off your bones .
But I won't attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
I sneeze on your manhood .
What news do you bring ?
Gloucester's eyes ?
There's justice in heaven after all !
That these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
But oh , poor Glou-cester !
Did he lose his other eye ?
He lost both , my lord. , Ma'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
He was on his way here with your wife .
But he isn't here now .
No , my lord .
Yes , my lord .
He was the one who denounced his father .
What else you do know ?
Do you know why the King of France suddenly went back home ?
It was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
Whom did he leave in charge here ?
The marshal of France , Monsieur la Far .
Was Queen Cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
Yes , sir .
She seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
So she was moved by it ?
If everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
She didn't ask anything ?
Actually , once or twice she sighed and said , "father , " as if the word were pressing on her chest .
Once she exclaimed , "Sisters , sisters , shame on you !
Kent , father , sisters !
What , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
I can't believe it." The tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
Then she ran away to grieve alone .
Have you not spoken to her since then ?
No .
Did this happen before the King of France returned home ?
No , afterward .
Why , good sir ?
He's too overwhelmed with shame .
He remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters .
All those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from Cordelia .
Oh , the poor man !
Have you heard about Albany's and Cornwall's troops ?
I have .
They're on the march .
Well , sir , I'll take you to Lear and have you stay with him a while .
I have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
When I've revealed my true identity , you'll be glad you took the time to help me out .
Please come with me .
Sadly , it's the king that's missing .
They saw him just now as mad and deranged as the stormy sea , singing loudly , wearing a crown of nettles , thorns , hemlock , and all the other weeds that grow in our cornfields. , Send out a hundred soldiers to find him .
Search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him .
There is a way , ma'am .
But there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .
Then I'll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
May they relieve a sick old man's suffering .
Go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
I have news , ma'am .
The British forces are on their way here .
We already knew that .
Our forces are ready for them .
Oh , father , I'm taking care of your business .
That's why the King of France listened to my pleas and tears .
We're not invading England out of ambition or greed , but out of love , dear love ! , and my father's right to his kingdom .
I hope I see him and hear him again soon .
Have my brother-in-law's troops been mobilized ?
Yes , ma'am .
Is he there in person ?
Yes , making a big fuss .
Your sister's the better soldier of the two .
Lord Edmund didn't speak to your master at home ?
No , ma'am .
What could my sister's letter to him say ?
I don't know , ma'am .
He rushed away on serious business .
It was a huge mistake to let old Gloucester live after we blinded him .
Wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
And also to find out the size of the enemy army .
I have to follow him and give him the letter .
Our troops are deployed tomorrow .
Stay with us tonight .
It's dangerous out there .
Peace to you , my lord of Burgundy .
Since you love money and power so much , I won't be your wife .
I'll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it's okay that I'm picking up what others have thrown away .
No Duke of spineless Burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now. , Say goodbye to them , Cordelia , even though they've been unkind to you .
She's no longer my daughter , and I'll never see her face again .
Say goodbye to your sisters .
I can't , ma'am .
My lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
Why would she write to Edmund ?
It probably has something to do with, I don't know .
Ma'am , I'd rather , I know your lady Goneril doesn't love her husband .
I'm sure of that .
And when she was here recently she flirted with Edmund and gave him significant glances .
I know she trusts you and tells you everything .
Me , ma'am ?
I know what I'm talking about .
So I recommend you take note of what I'm about to say .
My husband is dead .
Edmund and I have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than Goneril .
You can figure out the rest .
Goodbye .
When will we get to the top of that cliff ?
The ground feels flat to me .
No , it's dreadfully steep .
No , really , I don't .
Then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
It may be so .
It seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be .
You're mistaken about all that .
The only thing different about me is my clothes .
I think you're more articulate .
Come on , sir .
This is the place .
Stand still .
It's so scary to look down !
The crows flying down below look as small as ants .
Halfway down the cliff there's somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs , a risky business !
That big ship over there looks no bigger
Up here you can't even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
Lead me to where you're standing .
Give me your hand .
You're now within a foot of the cliff's edge .
Let go of my hand .
Goodbye , good sir .
With all my heart .
Oh , you mighty gods !
Gone , sir .
Goodbye .
Go away and let me die .
You just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
It's a miracle you're alive .
Say something again .
But did I fall or not ?
You fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
Look for yourself , see the top of the cliff way up there ?
The lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
Just look .
It used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
Give me your arm .
Get up .
How do you feel ?
Can you feel your legs ?
You're standing .
Only too well .
This is beyond weird .
What was that thing I saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
That was a poor unlucky beggar .
From down here , I thought his eyes looked like full moons .
He had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
It was some devil .
I understand now .
From now on I'll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , "Enough , enough ! " and disappears .
I thought that thing you're talking about was a man .
Cheer up and be at peace .
But who is that ?
I'm the king himself .
Life's better at
piece of cheese will get him. , I challenge you to a match .
Oh , that arrow was well shot .
Whoosh !
Sweet marjoram .
That's it !
I know that voice .
Ha !
Goneril with a white beard ?
I tell you , they are not honest men .
They told me I was everything .
I recognize something about that voice .
Isn't that the king ?
Yes , every inch a king .
I pardon that man .
What are you accused of ?
Adultery ?
I'll commute your death sentence .
To die for adultery ?
No .
Little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
Let's have more sex in the world , since Gloucester's bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me .
Get to it , be lustful , sleep around , I need soldiers for my army .
Women are sex machines below the waist , though they're chaste up above .
That's where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
Give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
There's money in it for you .
Oh , let me kiss his hand !
Let me wipe it off first .
I remember your eyes quite well .
Are you squinting at me ?
Read it .
How ?
With my eye sockets ?
Oh ho , is that what you're getting at ?
No eyes in your head til there's money in your wallet ?
What , are you crazy ?
You don't need eyes to see how the world works .
Look with your ears .
Look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
Have you seen a farmer's dog bark at a beggar ?
Yes , sir .
And you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
That's authority !
You stupid cop , stop your violence !
Why are you whipping that whore ?
You should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you're punishing her .
One criminal punishes another .
You can't blame anyone for it anyone , I say .
I'll vouch for that .
Believe me , my friend , since I have the power to stop the prosecutors .
Harder , harder .
Like that .
If you want to cry over my bad luck , I'll give you my eyes .
I know you .
Your name's Gloucester .
You have to be patient with me .
I came here crying .
The first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
I'll read you a sermon .
Listen to this .
Oh , how awful !
When we're born , we cry because we've arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools .
That's a nice hat you've got there .
How ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
I'll test it out .
And when I've sneaked up on my sons-in-law , then I'll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
What , I'm a prisoner ?
No rescue for me ?
Treat me well .
There's a ransom .
I need a doctor .
My brains are injured .
You can have anything you want .
Will no one back me up ?
Am I all alone ?
That would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
Good sir ,
I'll die You're of royal blood , and we obey you .
Then there's still a chance .
Come and get it !
But you'll have to catch me !
Catch me if you can !
Sa , sa , sa , sa .
In a king , the sight is unbearable .
Hello , good sir .
How do you do , sir .
How can I help you ?
Have you heard any news of impending battle ?
Certainly .
Everyone who can hear has heard about it .
Could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
Very near , and approaching fast .
The main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
Thank you , sir .
That's all I wanted to know .
I know you for what you really are , but as your sister I'm reluctant to criticize you .
I leave him in your care , but oh , if only I were still in his favor I could arrange for better care for him .
Goodbye to you both .
Don't tell us what our duty is .
Time will tell what you've got up your sleeve .
Have a good life .
Come with me , my dear Cordelia .
Sister , I have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
I think that our father will leave here tonight .
Yes , I'm sure he will , to stay with you .
Next month he'll stay with us .
He's so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
He has always loved Cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
The queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
Thank you , sir .
Gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
Don't tempt me to suicide again .
Pray well , father .
And who are you , good sir ?
I'm a poor man who's been humbled by many misfortunes .
Thank you very much .
May heaven bless you .
What good luck !
That blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
You old traitor , repent all your sins .
I hope you're strong enough to do it .
Whoa , man , you dare to support someone who's been proclaimed a traitor ?
Get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
Let go of his arm .
Oh no , sir , I won't let him go , sir , not without a good reason .
Let go of him , peasant , or you die !
I'll knock your teeth out , sir .
To hell with your sword .
I know you well .
You're a hardworking villain who'd do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
Is he dead ?
Let's look in his pockets .
The letters he spoke of may help me .
He's dead .
I'm just sorry I had to be the one to kill him .
Let's see here .
Come on , envelope , open up for me .
Reading their mail isn't as bad .
Don't forget the vows we made to each other .
The king is insane .
It'd be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
Give me your hand .
I think I hear the drums far away .
Come , father , I'll leave you at a friend's house .
Oh , Kent , what could I ever do to become as good as you are ?
I won't live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
Just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
I hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
Change into better clothes .
Please take them off .
I have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right .
All right , my lord. , How's the king doing ?
He's still sleeping , ma'am .
Would you mind if we woke up the king ?
He's slept a long time .
Is he in his royal garments ?
Yes , ma'am .
Stay close by when we wake him up , ma'am .
I'm sure he will stay under control .
All right .
Please come closer. , Make the music louder , please !
Kind and dear princess !
If you hadn't been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion .
And were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
Oh , oh !
It's a wonder you didn't lose your life and your mind all at once. , He's waking up .
Talk to him .
You talk to him , ma'am .
That's most appropriate .
How are you , my royal lord ?
How is your majesty doing ?
You do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
Even my tears burn me like molten lead .
Sir , do you know who I am ?
You're a spirit , I know .
Where did you die ?
Let him be for a bit .
Where have I been ?
Where am I ?
Is it daytime ?
I've been tricked .
I would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
I don't know what to say .
I can't even be sure these are my hands .
Let's see .
I feel this pinprick .
I wish I knew what is happening .
Please don't make fun of me .
I'm a foolish , senile old man , eighty-something years old , not an hour more or less .
To put it plainly , I'm afraid I'm not quite sane .
I feel I should recognize you and that man
I can't recall where I slept last night .
Don't laugh at me , but I swear I think this lady is my child Cordelia .
And I am , I am .
Are your tears wet ?
Yes , indeed they are .
Please don't cry .
If you have poison for me , I'll drink it .
But you didn't , even though you had every reason .
I had no reason , no reason .
Am I in France ?
You're in your own kingdom , sir .
Don't deceive me .
You can relax , ma'am .
His insane period is over .
But it's dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
Ask him to go in .
Don't trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
Would your highness like to take a walk ?
You'll have to bear with me .
Please forgive and forget .
I'm old and foolish .
Is it true , sir , that the Duke of Cornwall was killed as they say ?
Yes , it's true , sir .
Who is leading his men ?
They say Gloucester's bastard son is .
I hear that Edgar , Gloucester's exiled son , is with the Earl of Kent in Germany .
You can't trust all the rumors .
It's time to reassess the situation .
The British troops are coming near .
It will likely be a bloody fight .
Goodbye , sir .
I'm afraid that may be the case , madam .
Now , my sweet lord , you know how much I like you .
Tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
No .
I'm just worried that you've been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her .
No , I swear on my honor , I haven't , madam .
He's going senile .
But then again he's never really understood his own feelings very well .
Yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
Now that he's old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep-rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age .
We'll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing Kent .
There's still the King of France's farewell ceremony .
Let's put our heads together .
If our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us .
We'll have to think about it carefully .
We have to strike while the iron's hot .
I can't stand her .
Please , my lord , don't be friendly with her .
Don't worry about me. , Your sister and the duke are here .
Noble words , sir .
Why are we talking about this ?
Then let's meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
I'll meet you at your tent .
Goneril , are you coming with us ?
No .
It's the best thing to do .
Please come with me .
Wait until I read the letter .
I was ordered not to .
When the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and I'll return .
Goodbye , then .
I'll take a look at your letter .
Prepare your troops .
We'll be ready when the time comes .
Which one of them should I pick ?
Both ?
One ?
Neither ?
I can't enjoy either of them as long as the other one's alive .
Goneril would go crazy if I chose Regan , but it would be hard to get in with Goneril while her husband's still alive .
I'll use Albany's power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters , whichever one wants to , can get rid of him .
If I ever come back , I'll bring you good news .
Good luck , sir .
We have to get out of here , old man .
Let me help you up .
Let's go !
He and his daughter are captured .
Give me your hand .
Come on .
I can't go any further , sir .
Come on .
And that's true too .
Officers , take them away .
Guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
No , no , no , no !
Come on , let's go to prison .
The two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
When you ask for my blessing , I'll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .
In prison we'll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
Take them away .
My Cordelia , even the gods admire how much you've sacrificed for me .
Have I hugged you yet ?
Anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .
Wipe your eyes .
Our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
We'll watch them starve to death first .
Come on .
Come here , captain .
Listen .
I'll do it , sir .
When you've finished , you'll be a happy man .
Go immediately , and do exactly as I wrote down .
I can't pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
If it's work for a man , I'll do it .
tody of them so I can do what's best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom .
I sent the French queen with him too , for the same reason .
We need a more appropriate place to discuss Cordelia and her father .
I'm sorry , sir , but in this war I consider you a subordinate , not my equal .
That's for to me to decide .
Not so fast .
He has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him .
He'd really be your proxy if he married you .
You're so infatuated with him that you're hallucinating .
Are you trying to sleep with him ?
Nor is it up to you , my lord .
Yes it is , you half-blood .
Hang on a second .
What a farce !
You've got a sword , Gloucester .
Blow the trumpets .
Oh , I'm sick , sick !
I feel sicker and sicker .
She's not feeling well .
Take her to my tent .
Come here , herald. , Let the trumpet sound ! , Read this out .
Blow the trumpet !
Again !
Again !
Who are you ?
All right then , legitimate brother Edgar , I have to have your lands .
Look out , I'm on my way up .
Kent's been banished just like that ?
All this so suddenly ? , Edmund , what's going on ?
What's the news ?
I've lost my name and title to a traitor .
But I'm as noble as my opponent .
And who is that ?
Who's the spokesman for Edmund , Earl of Gloucester ?
I'm my own spokesman .
What do you have to say to me ?
Here's mine .
Normally I would ask you what your name is first .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart. , Trumpets , blow !
You were tricked into fighting , Gloucester .
According to the laws of war , you didn't have to fight a stranger .
I make the laws , not you .
Who can prosecute me for it ?
Oh , monstrous !
Don't ask me what I know .
Follow her .
She's desperate .
I've done everything you accuse me of , and more , much more .
You'll find out everything in due time .
I'm no less noble than you are , Edmund .
If I'm more noble than you , you've done me wrong .
My name is Edgar , and I'm your father's son .
The gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
You're right .
That's true .
Let me embrace you .
I swear I never hated you or your father !
I know , prince .
Where have you been hiding ?
How did you know what happened to your poor father ?
Listen to my little story , and when it's done , oh , my heart will break !
To escape the decree condemning me
I became his guide , I led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
I never , oh , what a mistake ! , revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when I was in my armor .
But his frail heart , too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness , gave out .
Your words have moved me , and maybe it'll do some good .
But go on .
You look like you have something more to say .
If there's anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
I'm almost ready to break down hearing this much .
This may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if I went on I could outdo it .
Then I heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
But who was that man ?
It was Kent , sir , the exiled Kent , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave .
Help , help , oh , help !
What kind of help do you need ?
Say something , man !
What is that bloody knife ?
It's still warm from the cut .
It was just removed from from the heart of , oh , she's dead !
Who's dead ?
Speak , man .
Your wife , sir , your wife .
And her sister's dead too , poisoned by your wife .
She confessed .
I was engaged to both of them .
All three of us will marry now in death .
Here comes Kent .
I thought the king preferred the Duke of Albany to the Duke of Cornwall .
We used to think so too .
But the way he's divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more .
Yes , I've been responsible for his upbringing .
I've had to acknowledge that he's my son so many times that now I can do it without embarrassment .
Do you smell something naughty ?
Well , I wouldn't want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
But I have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and I don't love him any more than I love my bastard .
Oh , is that Kent ?
I've come to say farewell to my king and master .
Isn't he here ?
What an enormous thing for us to forget ! , Edmund , tell us , where's the king ?
And where's Cordelia ? , Do you see this , Kent ?
Oh , why is this so ?
Still , Edmund was beloved .
One of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
Apparently so. , Cover their faces .
I wish I could live longer .
I want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
Go quickly , hurry , to the castle , for I've given orders to have Lear and Cordelia killed .
Hurry , send someone immediately !
Run , run , oh , run !
Whom should we look for in the castle ? , Whose job is it ?
Send something along to prove you're withdrawing the orders .
Good idea .
Take my sword .
The captain , give it to the captain .
Run as if your life depended on it .
My wife and I ordered him to hang Cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair .
Heaven help her ! , Get him out of here for now .
Howl , howl , howl , howl !
Oh , you men are made of stone !
If I were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , I'd crack heaven wide open with my laments !
She's gone forever .
I know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
She's as dead as the cold ground .
Let me borrow a mirror .
If her breath steams up the glass , then she's alive .
Or just a foretaste of it ?
Let the world collapse around us .
This feather moved because of her breath .
She's alive .
If that's true , it makes up for all the sorrows I've ever known .
Oh , my good master !
Please , go away .
It's noble Kent , your friend .
Curse you all , you're all murderers and traitors !
I could have saved her .
Now she's gone forever. , Cordelia , Cordelia , stay a while .
Ha ?
It's true , my lords , he did .
Didn't I ?
But I'm old now , and suffering has weakened me .
My vision is dull .
Aren't you Kent ?
That's me .
Your servant Kent .
Where's your servant
He's a good fellow , I can tell you that much .
He's dead and rotting in the dirt now .
No , my lord , that was me .
I'm the one who , I'll get right on that .
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
Nice to see you .
It was me , no one else .
Everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
Your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
Yes , I think that's true .
He doesn't know what he's saying .
Edmund is dead , my lord .
As for me , I'm surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life .
And my poor He's fainted. , My lord , my lord !
Don't disturb his soul .
Let it go up to heaven .
Oh , he's really gone .
What's amazing is how long he lasted .
Carry them away .
Our business now is mourning and grief .
Why are you hiding that letter ?
I don't have any news to report , my lord .
What's that paper you were reading ?
It's nothing , my lord .
No ?
Then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
If it were nothing , you wouldn't need to hide it .
Please , sir , I beg you .
It's a letter from my brother that I haven't finished reading yet .
Give me that letter , sir .
Now I'll offend you whether I give it to you or not .
The problem is in what the letter says , as far as I can tell .
I hope for my brother's sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
I will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
My master's calling me .
I can't say no .
We must remember the gravity of this sad day .
We should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
Come talk to me about this .
If our father were dead you'd receive half of his revenue forever , and you'd have my undying love , Edgar." Hmm , what's this , a conspiracy ?
How could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
How did you get this letter ?
Who delivered it ?
Nobody delivered it , my lord .
That's what's clever about it .
It was tossed into the window of my room .
You're sure the handwriting is your brother's ?
If he'd written nice things , I'd swear yes right away .
But as it stands , I wish I could believe it wasn't .
But it is his handwriting ?
It's his handwriting , my lord , but I hope he didn't mean what he wrote .
Has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
Never , my lord .
But I've often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money .
Oh , what a villain !
That's just what he said in the letter .
Evil villain !
Go look for him .
I'll arrest him .
Horrid villain !
Where is he ?
I'm not sure , my lord .
I'll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason .
Do you think so ?
He can't possibly be such a monster , And I'm sure he isn't .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
Oh , God !
Edmund , go find him .
I'll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as I can .
These recent eclipses of the sun and moon don't bode well for us .
Though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
Love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
This wicked son of mine confirms the prediction , son against father .
The king acts unnaturally , father against child .
We've seen the best our age has to offer .
Conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that's left until we die .
Find out what this villainous Edgar is thinking , Edmund .
You won't lose any respect .
Just do it carefully. , And to think that the noble and loyal Kent has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth !
It's strange , strange .
This is a classic example of the idiocy of the world : when we're down and out , often because of our own excesses , we put all the blame on the sun , the moon , and the stars , as if they forced us to be bad , or the heavens compelled us to be villainous or stupid .
My father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and I was born under the Big Dipper , so it's inevitable that I'm rude and oversexed .
I would have been what I am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception .
Fa , sol , la , mi .
Hello , brother Edmund .
What are you thinking about so seriously ?
How long have you believed in astrology ?
Come on .
When was the last time you saw my father ?
Why , last night .
Did you speak to him ?
Yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
Did you leave on good terms ?
Did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
No , none at all .
Some villain has told lies about me .
That's what I'm afraid of .
I suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
In the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right I'll take you to talk to him .
Please go .
Here's my key .
If you go outside , arm yourself .
Arm myself ?
Brother , I'm giving you good advice .
Arm yourself .
Now please go .
Will I hear from you soon ?
I'll help you through this business .
A gullible father and a brother who's so innocent that he can't suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him , these are the two fools I need for my plan to work .
I know exactly how to proceed .
If I can't have an estate by birthright , then I'll get it by being clever .
Any trick that works is good for me .
Did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
Yes , ma'am .
He constantly offends me .
Every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
I won't stand for it .
His knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
When he comes back from hunting , I'm not going to speak to him .
Tell him I'm sick .
And if you're not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that'll be good .
I'll take responsibility for it .
He's coming , ma'am .
I hear him .
Be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him , you and the other servants .
If he doesn't like it , he can go live with my sister .
That useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he's given away .
I swear , old fools become like babies again .
Remember what I've told you .
Very well , ma'am .
And make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
Don't worry about the consequences .
Tell your men as much .
I want this to provoke confrontations , so I can give him a piece of my mind .
I'll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
Now go , set up for dinner .
If I can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then I'll be able to carry out my plan perfectly .
I love my master , and he'll find me very hard-working .
Don't make me wait for dinner even a moment .
Get it ready immediately .
A man , sir .
What's your profession ?
What do you want from me ?
But who are you ?
An honest guy who's as poor as the king .
If you're as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
What do you want ?
To work as a servant .
Who do you want to work for ?
You .
Do you know me ?
Authority .
What work can you do ?
I can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
I'm good at everything that ordinary men can do .
The best thing about me is that I'm hardworking .
How old are you ?
Not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason .
I'm forty-eight .
Follow me .
You'll work for me .
Where's my fool ? , Go call my fool and have him come here .
No , I don't , my lord .
Very pleased to meet you , my lord .
I look forward to getting to know you better .
I'll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
He's been gone for nine years and he's leaving again soon .
The king is coming .
Go escort the lords of France and Burgundy , Gloucester .
Yes , my lord .
You , sir , where's my daughter ?
I beg your pardon , sir , What did that guy say ?
Call the numbskull back in here .
Where's my fool ?
You'd think everyone was asleep .
So what's going on ?
Where's that dog ?
He says your daughter's not feeling well , my lord .
Why didn't the jerk come back to me when I called him ?
Sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn't feel like it .
Didn't feel like it ?
My lord , I don't know what's going on , but it seems to me that your highness isn't being treated as politely as before .
The servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
Huh !
Do you really mean that ?
Please forgive me if I'm mistaken , my lord , but I can't keep quiet when I think you're being insulted .
No , you're just reminding me of something I've also noticed .
I've felt neglected recently , but I decided that it was more likely that I was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind .
I'll look into it further .
But where's my fool ?
I haven't seen him for two days .
Ever since Cordelia left for France , sir , the fool has been depressed .
Let's not talk about it .
I've noticed it myself .
Go and tell my daughter I want to speak with her .
And you , go call my fool .
You there , sir , come here please .
Who am I , sir ?
You scoundrel !
You lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
You dog , you peasant !
I won't be hit , my lord .
Now , my friendly servant , thank you .
Wait , let me hire him too. , Here's my fool's cap , a token of my gratitude .
Well hello , my good boy .
How are you doing ?
Why , Fool ?
Why ?
For standing up for this unpopular king .
No , if you can't adjust to political changes , you'll suffer for it .
There , take my fool's cap .
This guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
If you work for him , you're a fool and should wear a fool's cap. , So how's it going , uncle ?
I wish I had two fool's caps and two daughters .
Why , my boy ?
If I gave them all I own , I'd have two fool's caps for myself .
Here's mine .
Ask your daughters for another one .
Watch out , boy , remember I can whip you .
A constant pain to me !
I'll recite something for you , guy .
Yes , do that .
Listen up , uncle .
Have more than you show , Speak less than you know , Lend less than you owe .
It's nothing .
In that case it's like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
Why , no , boy .
Nothing can be made out of nothing .
You're a bitter fool .
Do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
No , son .
Tell me .
Bring here The gentleman who advised you To give away your land .
You can stand in his place .
The sweet and bitter fool Will appear right away .
The sweet fool in a fool's costume , that's me .
The bitter one is the other one , that's you.LEAR Are you calling me a fool , boy ?
Well , you've given away all your other rightful titles .
No .
Which two crowns would those be ?
Well , when I cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns .
If I'm telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks I sound foolish .
When did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
I've been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power .
That's when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , Please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie .
I want to learn how to lie .
If you lie , boy , we'll have you whipped .
I'm amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
They want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes I'm even whipped for keeping quiet .
I'd rather be anything besides a fool .
And yet I wouldn't want to be you , uncle .
Here comes the owner of one piece .
What's going on , daughter ?
Why are you frowning like that ?
I think you've been frowning too much recently .
The man who gives away his crust and his crumbs Will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
will damage your reputation with them , and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .
However , this is an extreme situation , and it's more important to control it than to worry about how you'll look .
You know , uncle , A sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest Until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow's head off .
So the candle went out and now we're all in the dark .
Are you my daughter ?
Does anyone here know who I am ?
I'm not Lear .
Where are his eyes ?
I don't think so .
Who can tell me who I am ?
You're Lear's shadow .
Daughters who can make you obey them .
This fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
I'm asking you to understand my point of view .
Since you're old and respected , you should be wise .
But you're keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel .
They're such oversexed gluttons that I feel like we're living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace .
It's shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
Hell and damnation !
Saddle up my horses .
Call my knights together .
You're not really my daughter , but I still have one daughter left .
You hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
You'll be sorry later , but it'll be too late .
Ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
Please , sir , be patient .
That may be true , my lord .
Ah , dear Nature , my goddess , listen to me !
Make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her .
This land will belong to your and Albany's children forever. , And now what does my second daughter Regan , the wife of Cornwall , have to say ?
Tell me .
Dear gods in heaven , what's the reason for this ?
And then you'll see that despite what you thought , I'll be as powerful as I was before .
You'll see , I promise you .
Did you hear that ?
Goneril , you know how much I love you , but still I have to say , Shush , please .
Come , sir , no more. , Oswald , come here !
A fox you've trapped And such a daughter Should both be slaughtered , If my fool's cap is worth a rope to bind them .
So the fool follows you .
My father can't think straight , a hundred knights !
You may be exaggerating the risks .
That's better than exaggerating our trust .
It's always better to get rid of what you're scared of than to be afraid .
I know how his mind works .
I've written to my sister telling her everything he's said .
If she welcomes him and his hundred knights after I've shown how inappropriately he's behaved , Here , ma'am .
Well , Oswald ?
Have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
Yes , ma'am .
Take some men and horses and go to her .
Add details of your own to back up what I'm saying .
Now go , and hurry back .
But people often screw things up trying to make them better .
No , not at all , All right , all right .
I won't sleep until I've delivered your letter , my lord .
If a man's brain were in his feet , wouldn't it be susceptible to frostbite ?
Yes , boy .
Ha , ha , ha !
Your other daughter Regan will treat you kindly , you'll see .
Even though she's as similar to Goneril as one crabapple is like another , still, I know what I know .
And what do you know , boy ?
I know that Regan will taste just like Goneril , both of them sour crabapples .
Do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person's face ?
No .
Why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you can't sniff out .
I was wrong to her , Do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
No .
Me neither .
But I know why a snail carries its house on its back .
Why ?
He can't give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
I want to forget what I am .
Such a kind father ! , Are my horses ready ?
Your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
There's a nice reason why the constellation Pleiades has only seven stars in it .
Because it doesn't have eight ?
That's right .
You'd make a good fool .
I could take back my crown by force , What outrageous ingratitude !
If you were my fool , uncle , I'd have you beaten for getting old before your time .
How's that ?
You're not supposed to get old until you're wise .
Oh , dear God , don't let me go mad !
Keep me balanced and sane .
I don't want to go mad .
They're ready , my lord .
Come on , boy .
Hello , Curan .
Hello , sir .
I just saw your father the Lord Gloucester and notified him that the Duke of Cornwall and his wife Regan will stay with him here tonight .
Why is that ?
I don't know .
You haven't heard of the war brewing between the Dukes of Cornwall and Albany ?
Not a word .
You may hear about it soon .
Goodbye , sir .
The duke will be here tonight ?
His arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
Fast work and a little luck are all I need. , Brother , could I have a word with you ?
Come down , brother .
Father is on the lookout .
Get out of here quickly !
It has leaked out that you're hiding here .
You haven't said anything against the Duke of Cornwall , have you ?
He's rushing on his way here right now , and Regan's with him .
Think about it .
I hear my father coming .
Forgive me .
I have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
Be convincing .
Edmund , where's your wicked brother ?
Look , sir , I'm bleeding .
Where is the villain , Edmund ?
He ran out that way , sir , when he couldn't , Follow him , now !
Go .
When he couldn't what ?
In short , when I told him how firmly opposed I was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm .
Bolstered by righteousness , I prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement , or perhaps because my shouting scared him , he ran away suddenly .
Let him run far away .
If he stays in this country he'll be found .
The Duke of Cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
joy except my love for you , and I find that only your majesty's love makes me happy .
Speak .
Nothing , my lord .
Nothing ?
Nothing .
Come on , "nothing" will get you nothing .
Try again .
I don't have a talent for putting my heart's feelings into words .
I love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
What are you saying , Cordelia ?
Revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
justice will be rewarded .
He answered , "You penniless bastard !
Do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
No .
I'd deny whatever evidence you had against me , even if it were in my own handwriting , and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery .
And you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn't realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me." Oh , how monstrously evil !
He said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
The duke's trumpets .
I don't know why he's come here .
I'll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
The villain won't escape .
The duke will agree with me on that .
How are you , my friend ?
Ever since I arrived here , just now , I've been hearing strange rumors .
How are you , my lord ?
Oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
Oh , my lady , I'm ashamed to admit it .
Wasn't he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
I don't know , madam .
Oh , it's too terrible .
To answer your question , ma'am , yes , he was friendly with those knights .
Then it's no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
They probably put him up to killing old man Gloucester to get his money .
Tonight I received a letter from my sister telling me all about them , and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house .
And I won't be there either. , Edmund , I'm told you've acted like a true son to your father .
I just did my duty , sir .
He exposed Edgar's murderous plot , and was wounded , as you see there , when trying to apprehend him .
Are your men searching for him ?
Yes , my lord .
If he's caught , he'll never make trouble for anyone again .
I need people as trustworthy as you .
I'll always be loyal to you , sir .
You don't know why we came to visit you , Yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
Their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
So please , old friend , give us some good advice .
I'm at your service , madam .
Both of you are very welcome here .
Good morning to you , friend .
Do you work in this house ?
Yes , I do .
Where should we stable our horses ?
In the mud .
Please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
I won't be kind to you .
In that case , I don't much care for you either .
If I could get my hands on you , I'd make you care .
Why are you talking to me like this ?
I don't even know you .
Ah , but I know you .
Who am I then ?
What an ogre you are to slander someone you don't know , and who doesn't know you !
What a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don't know me !
It was just two days ago that I tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
Draw your sword , scoundrel .
I'll make ground beef out of you .
Get away from me !
I've got nothing to do with you .
Draw your sword , you jerk !
You come here with letters against the king , and you take his conceited daughter's side against his royal highness .
Draw your sword , scoundrel , or I'll slice your thighs like flank steak .
Draw your sword !
Come on !
Help !
Murderer !
Help !
Stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
Help !
Murder , murder !
Macbeth .
Then stay with us .
There's still a bit of daylight in the sky .
Now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
The rest of the king's guests are already inside .
That's him .
Prepare yourselves .
It will rain tonight .
Then let the rain come down .
Oh , this is treachery !
Get out of here , good Fleance , run , run , run !
Someday you can get revenge. , Oh , you bastard !
Who put out the light ?
Wasn't that the best thing to do ?
There's only one body here .
The son ran away .
We failed in half of our mission .
Well , let's get out of here and tell Macbeth what we did accomplish .
From the highest to the lowest of you , I bid you a hearty welcome .
Thanks to your majesty .
I will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
Say welcome to all of our friends for me , sir , for in my heart they are all welcome .
And they respond to you with their hearts as well .
The table is full on both sides .
I will sit here in the middle .
Be free and happy .
Soon we will toast around the table .
Then it must be Banquo's .
My lord , his throat is cut .
I did that to him .
You are the best of the cutthroats .
If you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
Most royal sir , Fleance has escaped .
Now I'm scared again .
Otherwise I would have been perfect , as solid as a piece of marble , as firm as a rock , as free as the air itself .
Yes , my good lord .
He's lying dead in a ditch , with twenty deep gashes in his head , any one of which would have been enough to kill him .
Thanks for that .
The adult snake lies in the ditch .
The young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening , but for now he has no fangs .
Get out of here .
I'll talk to you again tomorrow .
My royal lord , you're not entertaining the guests .
When you just want to eat , it's better to do that at home .
Where have you been , sister ?
Killing pigs .
And you , sister ?
A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
Give me one , " I said .
Get away from me , witch ! " the fat woman cried .
How nice of you !
And I will give you some more .
I'll drain the life out of him .
He won't catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
He will live as a cursed man .
For eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
It's nice of you to remind me .
Why don't you have a seat , your highness ?
His absence means he's broken his promise , sir .
If it pleases you , your highness , why don't you sit with us and grace us with your royal company ?
The table's full .
Here's an empty seat , sir .
Where ?
What , my good lord ?
Gentlemen , stand up .
His highness is not well .
Sit down , worthy friends .
My husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
Please stay seated .
If you pay too much attention to him you'll make him angry , and that will make his convulsions go on longer .
Eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
Yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
Oh , that's nonsense !
This is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you're afraid .
These outbursts of yours don't even look like real fear .
They're more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .
Shame on you !
Why are you making these faces ?
When the vision passes , you'll see that you're just looking at a stool .
Please , just look over there .
Look !
Look !
As sure as I'm standing here , I saw him .
Nonsense !
It used to be that when you knocked a man's brains out he would just die , and that would be it .
But now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
This haunting business is even stranger than murder .
My worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
Too bad it's spoiling our pleasure tonight .
Come at me in the form of a rugged Russian bear , an armor-plated rhinoceros , or a tiger from Iran .
Or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
If I tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
Get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
Get out !
I am a man again .
Pray you sit still .
Please , remain seated .
What things , my lord ?
Please , don't speak to him .
He's getting worse and worse .
Talk makes him crazy .
Good night .
A kind good night to all !
Gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
It's almost morning .
Did you send for him , sir ?
I've heard about this indirectly , but I will send for him .
In every one of the lords ' households I have a servant paid to spy for me .
Tomorrow , while it's still early , I will go see the witches .
They will tell me more , because I'm determined to know the worst about what's going to happen .
My own safety is the only important thing now .
I have to do these things before I have a chance to think about them .
Yes , let's go to sleep .
My strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
We're still just beginners when it comes to crime .
What's wrong , Hecate ?
You look angry .
Don't I have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
But you can make it up to me .
Go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
Macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
You bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
I'm about to fly away .
I'll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
I have a lot to do before noon .
An important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
I'll catch it before it falls to the ground .
When I work it over with magic spells , the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick Macbeth with illusions .
He will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate , he will mock death , and he will think he is above wisdom , grace , and fear .
As you all know , overconfidence is man's greatest enemy .
Listen !
I'm being called .
Look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
All I'm saying is that strange things have been going on .
Clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
And who can help thinking how monstrous it was for Malcolm and Donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
Those are the things we pine for now .
Macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he's preparing for war .
Did he tell Macduff to return to Scotland ?
I'll send my prayers with him .
Although I can't make his ship disappear , I can still make his journey miserable .
Look what I have here .
Show me , show me .
A drum , a drum !
Macbeth has come .
The tawny cat has meowed three times .
My spirit friend , Harpier , is yelling , "It's time , it's time ! " Dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
Double , double toil and trouble , Fire burn and cauldron bubble .
We'll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
Well done !
I admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
Now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies , enchanting everything you put in .
I can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
Doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
What's going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
What are you doing ?
Something there isn't a word for .
Tell me what I want to know .
Speak .
Demand .
We'll answer .
Would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master's ?
Call them .
Let me see them .
Pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
Tell me , you unknown power , He can read your thoughts .
Listen , but don't speak .
Macbeth !
Macbeth !
Macbeth !
Beware Macduff .
Beware the thane of Fife .
Let me go .
Enough .
Whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
You have guessed exactly what I feared .
But one word more , He will not be commanded by you .
Here's another , stronger than the first .
Macbeth !
If I had three ears I'd listen with all three .
Be violent , bold , and firm .
Laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm Macbeth .
But even so , I'll make doubly sure .
That way I can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
What is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head ?
Listen but don't speak to it .
Be brave like the lion and proud .
Macbeth will never be defeated until Birnam Wood marches to fight you at Dunsinane Hill .
That will never happen .
Who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
These were sweet omens !
Good !
My murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of Birnam gets up and moves , and I will be king for my entire natural life .
But my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
Tell me , if your dark powers can see this far : will Banquo's sons ever reign in this kingdom ?
Don't try to find out more .
I demand to be satisfied .
If you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
Let me know .
Why is that cauldron sinking ?
And what is that music ?
Show .
Show .
Show .
Show him and make him grieve .
Come like shadows and depart in the same way !
You look too much like the ghost of Banquo .
Go away !
What ?
Is this true ?
Come , sisters , let's cheer him up and show him our talents .
Where are they ?
Gone ?
Let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
What does your grace want ?
Did you see the weird sisters ?
No , my lord .
Didn't they pass by you ?
No , indeed , my lord .
I heard the galloping of horses .
Who was it that came here ?
Two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that Macduff has fled to England .
Fled to England ?
Yes , my good lord .
Time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
No more foolish talk .
I will do this deed before I lose my sense of purpose .
But no more spooky visions ! , Where are the messengers ?
Come , bring me to them .
What did he do that made him flee this land ?
You have to be patient , madam .
He had no patience .
He was crazy to run away .
Even if you're not a traitor , you're going to look like one if you run away .
You don't know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
How could it be wisdom !
To leave his wife , his children , his house , and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it !
Even the fragile wren , the smallest of birds , will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest .
His running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
My dearest relative , I'm begging you , pull yourself together .
As for your husband , he is noble , wise , and judicious , and he understands what the times require .
I'll say good-bye now .
It won't be long before I'm back .
When things are at their worst they have to stop , or else improve to the way things were before .
He has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
If I stay longer , I'll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
I'm leaving now .
Young man , your father's dead .
What are you going to do now ?
How are you going to live ?
What ?
Are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
I mean I will live on whatever I get , like birds do .
You'd be a pitiful bird .
You wouldn't know enough to be afraid of traps .
No matter what you say , my father is not dead .
Yes , he is dead .
What are you going to do for a father ?
Maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
Oh , I can buy twenty husbands at any market .
Speak , if you can .
All hail , Macbeth !
Hail to you , thane of Glamis !
All hail , Macbeth !
Hail !
Hail !
Hail !
You are lesser than Macbeth but also greater .
You are not as happy as Macbeth , yet much happier .
Your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
So all hail , Macbeth and Banquo !
If so , you'd be buying them to sell again .
You talk like a child , but you're very smart anyway .
Was my father a traitor , Mother ?
Yes , he was .
What is a traitor ?
Someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
And is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
Everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
And should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
Everyone .
Who should hang them ?
The honest men .
Then the liars are fools , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them .
If he were dead , you'd be weeping for him .
If you aren't weeping , it's a good sign that I'll soon have a new father .
Silly babbler , how you talk !
Bless you , fair lady !
You don't know me , but I know you're an important person .
I'm afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
If you'll take a simple man's advice , don't be here when it arrives .
Go away and take your children .
I feel bad for scaring you like this , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm .
And harm is getting close !
Heaven keep you safe !
Where should I go ?
I haven't done anything wrong .
But I have to remember that I'm here on Earth , where doing evil is often praised , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake .
So then why should I offer this womanish defense that I'm innocent ?
Who are these men ?
Where is your husband ?
I hope he's not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
He's a traitor .
You're lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
What's that , you runt ?
He has killed me , Mother .
Run away , I beg you !
Let's seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
Instead of crying , let's keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men .
Each day new widows howl , new orphans cry , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face , until it sounds like heaven itself feels Scotland's anguish and screams in pain .
What you just said may perhaps be true .
This tyrant , whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it , was once considered an honest man .
You were one of his favorites .
He hasn't done anything to harm you yet .
It would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like Macbeth .
I am not treacherous .
But Macbeth is .
Even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
But I beg your pardon .
My fears can't actually make you evil .
Angels are still bright even though Lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
Even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
Why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable , the most precious things in your life , those strong bonds of love ?
But I beg you , don't interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
You may really be honest , no matter what I think .
Bleed , bleed , poor country !
I wouldn't be the villain you think I am even if I were offered all of Macbeth's kingdom and the riches of the East too .
Don't be offended .
I don't completely distrust you .
I do think Scotland is sinking under Macbeth's oppression .
Our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
The English have promised me thousands of troops .
Who are you talking about ?
Even in hell you couldn't find a devil worse than Macbeth .
I admit that he's murderous , lecherous , greedy , lying , deceitful , violent , malicious , and guilty of every sin that has a name .
But there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
Your wives , your daughters , your old women , and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust .
It would be better for Macbeth to rule than someone like me .
Endless greed and lust in a man's nature is a kind of tyranny .
It has caused the downfall of many kings .
But don't be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
There are more than enough willing women around .
Greed has been the downfall of many kings .
But I don't have any good sides .
No , if I had power I would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
Oh Scotland , Scotland !
If someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
I'm still a virgin .
Indeed , before you arrived here , old Siward , with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle , was making his way here .
Why are you silent ?
It's hard to make sense of such different stories .
Well , we'll speak more soon .
Yes , sir .
Their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine , but when he touches them , they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .
Thank you , doctor .
What disease is he talking about ?
It's called the evil .
Edward's healing touch is a miracle that I have seen him perform many times during my stay in England .
Along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
Who's that coming over here ?
By his dress I can tell he's my countryman , but I don't recognize him .
My noble kinsman , welcome .
Hello , sir .
Is Scotland the same as when I left it ?
Alas , our poor country !
It's too frightened to look at itself .
Oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
Banquo and Macbeth , all hail !
Stay and tell me more .
Tell me where you learned these strange things , and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting ?
Speak , I command you .
The earth has bubbles , just like the water , and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth .
Where did they disappear to ?
I wish they had stayed !
Were these things we're talking about really here ?
Or are we both on drugs ?
Your children will be kings .
You will be the king .
Isn't that what they said ?
That's exactly what they said .
Who's this ?
How is my wife ?
She's well .
And all my children ?
They're well too .
What's the news ?
Now is the time when we need your help .
Gracious King Edward has sent us noble Siward and ten thousand soldiers .
I wish I could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
What is this news about ?
If it's for me , don't keep it from me .
Let me have it now .
I think I can guess what you're about to say .
Your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
Merciful heaven !
They killed my children too ?
They killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
And I had to be away !
My wife was killed too ?
I said she was .
Take comfort .
He doesn't have children .
All my pretty little children ?
Did you say all ?
Oh , that bird from hell !
All of them ?
What , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
Fight it like a man .
I can't help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
Did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
Sinful Macduff , they were killed because of you !
As wicked as I am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
May God give their souls rest .
Let this anger sharpen your sword .
Transform your grief into anger .
I could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how I will avenge them !
But gentle heavens , don't keep me waiting .
Bring me face to face with Macbeth , that devil of Scotland .
Put him within the reach of my sword , and if he escapes , may heaven forgive him as well !
Now you sound like a man .
Come on , let's go see King Edward .
The army is ready .
Macbeth is ripe for the picking .
Cheer up as much as you can .
I've stayed up with you for two nights now , and I haven't seen any evidence of what you were talking about .
When was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
Since Macbeth went to war , I have seen her rise from her bed , put on her nightgown , unlock her closet , take out some paper , fold it , write on it , read it , seal it up , and then return to bed , remaining asleep the entire time .
When she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
She says something , sir , but I will not repeat it to you .
I will not confess it to you nor to anyone else , because there was no one else to witness her speech .
Look , here she comes !
This is exactly how she always looks , and , I swear it , she is fast asleep .
Watch her .
How did she get that candle ?
It stands by her bedside .
She always has to have a light next to her .
Those are her orders .
You see , her eyes are open .
Yes , but they don't see anything .
What's she doing now ?
Look how she rubs her hands .
She looks like she's washing her hands .
There's still a spot here .
Listen !
She's talking .
I'll write down what she says , so I'll remember it better .
Did you hear that ?
The thane of Fife had a wife .
Where is she now ? , What , will my hands never be clean ? , No more of that , my lord , no more of that .
You've heard something you shouldn't have .
She said something she shouldn't have said , I'm sure of that .
Heaven knows what secrets she's keeping .
I still have the smell of blood on my hand .
All the perfumes of Arabia couldn't make my little hand smell better .
Oh , oh , oh !
What a heavy sigh !
Her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
I wouldn't want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
Well , well , well .
I hope what she's saying is well , sir !
This disease is beyond my medical skills .
But I have known people who sleepwalked and weren't guilty of anything .
Wash your hands .
Put on your nightgown .
Is this true ?
To bed , to bed !
There's a knocking at the gate .
Will she go to bed now ?
Yes , right away .
Unnatural acts will cause Good night , good doctor .
The English army is near , led by Malcolm , his uncle Siward , and the good Macduff .
They burn for revenge .
Does anyone know if Donalbain is with his brother ?
He is definitely not there , sir .
I have a list of all the important men .
What is the tyrant Macbeth doing ?
He is fortifying his castle at Dunsinane with heavy defenses .
One thing is certain : he's out of control .
Who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he's done ?
Let's proceed on our march to Birnam .
He was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of Norway , and that you weren't the least bit afraid of death , even as you killed everyone around you .
Messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
The king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
Why are you giving me his title ?
I don't know whether he fought on Norway's side , or if he secretly aided the rebels , or if he fought with both of our enemies .
Don't bring me any more reports .
Until Birnam Wood gets up and moves to Dunsinane , I won't be affected by fear .
What's the boy Malcolm ?
Wasn't he born from a woman ?
The spirits that know the future have told me this : "Don't be afraid , Macbeth .
No man born from a woman will ever defeat you." So get out of here , disloyal thanes , and join the weak and decadent English !
My mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
May the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
Why do you look like a frightened goose ?
There are ten thousand , Geese , you idiot ?
Soldiers , sir .
Go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
What soldiers , fool ?
Curse you !
That pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
What soldiers , milk-face ?
The English army , sir .
Get out of my sight .
Seyton ! , I'm sick at heart when I see , Seyton , come here ! , This battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne .
I have lived long enough .
Seyton !
What do you want ?
Is there more news ?
All the rumors have been confirmed .
I'll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
Give me my armor .
You don't need it yet .
I'll put it on anyway .
Send out more cavalry .
Give me my armor .
She is not sick , my lord , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping .
Cure her of that .
For that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
Medicine is for the dogs .
I won't have anything to do with it .
Yes , my good lord .
Your preparation for war sounds like something .
Kinsmen , I hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
We don't doubt it .
What's the name of this forest behind us ?
Birnam Wood .
Tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
That way we can conceal how many of us there are , and Macbeth's spies will give him inaccurate reports .
We'll do it .
We shouldn't make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
Hang our flags on the outer walls .
Everyone keeps yelling , "Here they come ! " Our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige .
They can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
If it weren't for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them , we could have met them out in front of the castle , man to man , and beaten them back to England .
What's that noise ?
It's women crying , my good lord .
I've almost forgotten what fear feels like .
There was a time when I would have been terrified by a shriek in the night , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when I heard a ghost story .
What was that cry for ?
The queen is dead , my lord .
She would have died later anyway .
Tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
Out , out , brief candle .
Life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
My gracious lord , I should tell you what I saw , but I don't know how to say it .
Just say it .
As I was standing watch on the hill , I looked toward Birnam , and I thought I saw the forest begin to move .
Liar and slave !
Punish me if it's not true .
Three miles from here you can see it coming , a moving forest .
If you're lying , I'll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger .
If what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
We're close enough now .
Good luck .
If we meet Macbeth's army tonight , let us be beaten if we can not fight .
They have me tied to a stake .
I can't run away .
You'll be afraid to hear it .
No I won't , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
My name's Macbeth .
The devil himself couldn't say a name I hate more .
No , nor could the devil's name be more frightening .
You lie , you disgusting tyrant .
I'll prove with my sword that I'm not scared of you .
You were born from a woman .
Swords don't frighten me .
I laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
But this whole thing is strange .
The noise is coming from over there .
Tyrant , show your face !
I'll either fight you , Macbeth , or else I'll put down my sword unused .
You must be over there .
Come this way , my lord .
Our noblemen are battling bravely .
Sir , enter the castle .
Turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
But go away now .
I have nothing to say to you .
My sword will talk for me .
You are too evil for words !
You might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
I lead a charmed life , which can't be ended by anyone born from a woman .
I won't fight you .
Then surrender , coward , and we'll put you in a freakshow , just like they do with deformed animals .
We'll put a picture of you on a sign , right above the words "Come see the tyrant ! " I'm not going to surrender and have to kiss the ground in front of Malcolm , or be taunted by the common people .
Even though Birnam Wood really did come to Dunsinane , and I'm fighting a man not of woman born , I'll fight to the end .
I'll put up my shield and battle you .
Come on , let's go at it , Macduff , and damn the first man who cries , 'Stop !
Enough !
Macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
My lord , your son has paid the soldier's price : death .
He only lived long enough to become a man , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one , he died .
So he's dead ?
Yes , and he's been carried off the field .
Your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
Were his wounds on his front side ?
Yes , on his front .
Well then , he's God's soldier now !
If I had as many sons as I have hairs on my head , I couldn't hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did .
And that's all there is to it .
He is worth more mourning than that , and I will mourn for him .
He is worth no more than that .
They tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
With that , I hope God is with him !
Here comes better news .
Hail , king !
Because that's what you are now .
Look , here I have Macbeth's cursed head .
We are free from his tyranny .
Hail , King of Scotland !
My thanes and kinsmen , I name you all earls , the first earls that Scotland has ever had .
So I thank you all , and I invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of Scotland at Scone .
Look at Macbeth , he's in a daze .
Good Macbeth , we're ready when you are .
Kind gentlemen , I won't forget the trouble you've taken for me whenever I think of this day .
Let's go to the king .
Absolutely .
Until then , we've said enough .
My king , they haven't come back yet .
But I spoke with someone who saw Cawdor die , and he said that Cawdor openly confessed his treasons , begged your highness's forgiveness , and repented deeply .
He never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
He died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage .
There's no way to read a man's mind by looking at his face .
You are welcome here .
With that , I'll be off .
My worthy Cawdor !
When should the three of us meet again ?
Will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
That will happen before sunset .
Where should we meet ?
We'll meet Macbeth there .
When I tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
While I stood spellbound , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of Cawdor , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me 'the future king !
What news do you bring ?
The king is coming here tonight .
You must be crazy to say that !
He sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message .
Take good care of him .
He brings great news .
My dearest love , Duncan is coming here tonight .
And when is he leaving ?
He plans to leave tomorrow .
That day will never come .
Your face betrays strange feelings , my lord , and people will be able to read it like a book .
Greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
You should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
We will speak about this further .
Leave all the rest to me .
This castle is in a pleasant place .
The air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
The fact that this summer bird , the house martin , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are .
There isn't a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven't built their hanging nests to sleep and breed .
I've noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
Look , here comes our honored hostess !
Sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but I still accept it as love .
Fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
We are your servants , your highness , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal , for after all , we keep it in your trust and we're glad to give you back what's yours .
Give me your hand .
Bring me to my host , Macbeth .
I love him dearly , and I shall continue to favor him .
Whenever you're ready , hostess .
If this business would really be finished when I did the deed , then it would be best to get it over with quickly .
What news do you have ?
He has almost finished dinner .
Why did you leave the dining room ?
Has he asked for me ?
Don't you know he has ?
We can't go on with this plan .
The king has just honored me , and I have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
Were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
From now on this is what I'll think of your love .
Are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
You're like the poor cat in the old story .
If you weren't a man , then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this ?
And whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
May you only give birth to male children , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn't masculine .
Once we have covered the two servants with blood , and used their daggers to kill , won't people believe that they were the culprits ?
Go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
Hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
How's the night going , boy ?
The moon has set .
The clock hasn't struck yet .
The moon sets at twelve , right ?
I think it's later than that , sir .
Here , take my sword .
The heavens are being stingy with their light .
Take this , too .
I'm tired and feeling heavy , but I can't sleep .
Merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when I rest !
Give me my sword .
Who's there ?
A friend .
You're not asleep yet , sir ?
The king's in bed .
He's been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
This diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
Because we were unprepared for the king's visit , we weren't able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to .
Who is this bloody man ?
Judging from his appearance , I bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
This is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
Hail , brave friend !
Tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
The armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water , unable to move .
My brave relative !
What a worthy man !
Everything's OK .
I had a dream last night about the three witches .
I don't think about them now .
But when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it , if you're willing .
Whenever you like .
If you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
Rest easy in the meantime .
Thank you , sir .
You do the same .
Is this a dagger I see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
I'm going now .
Don't listen to the bell , Duncan , because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
The alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
The same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
Listen !
Quiet !
My husband !
I have done the deed .
Did you hear a noise ?
I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
Didn't you say something ?
When ?
Just now .
As I came down ?
Yes .
Listen !
Who's sleeping in the second chamber ?
Donalbain .
That's a stupid thing to say .
One servant cried , "God bless us ! " and the other replied , "Amen , " as if they had seen my bloody hands .
Listening to their frightened voices , I couldn't reply "Amen" when they said "God bless us ! " Don't think about it so much .
But why couldn't I say "Amen" ?
I desperately needed God's blessing , but the word "Amen" stuck in my throat .
We can't think that way about what we did .
If we do , it'll drive us crazy .
I thought I heard a voice cry , "Sleep no more !
What are you talking about ?
The voice kept crying , "Sleep no more ! " to everyone in the house .
Go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
Why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
They have to stay there .
Go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
Coward !
Give me the daggers .
Only children are afraid of scary pictures .
If Duncan bleeds I'll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
Where is that knocking coming from ?
What's happening to me , that I'm frightened of every noise ?
I hear someone knocking at the south entry .
Let's go back to our bedroom .
A little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
It's so simple !
You've lost your resolve .
Listen !
There's more knocking .
Put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we're awake .
Snap out of your daze .
Wake Duncan with your knocking .
I wish you could !
Knock , knock , knock !
Knock , knock !
Who's there , in the other devil's name ?
Come on in , con man .
Knock , knock , knock !
Who's there ?
Maybe it's an English tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people's clothes .
Come on in , tailor .
You can heat your iron up in here .
Knock , knock !
Never a moment of peace !
Who are you ?
Ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
I won't pretend to be the devil's porter anymore .
I'm coming , I'm coming !
Please , don't forget to leave me a tip .
Did you go to bed so late , my friend , that you're having a hard time getting up now ?
What three things does drink make a man do ?
It sets you up for a fall .
It persuades you and discourages you .
I believe drink did all of this to you last night .
Is your master awake ?
Our knocking woke him up .
Here he comes .
Good morning , noble sir .
Good morning to both of you .
Is the king awake , worthy thane ?
Not yet .
He commanded me to wake him up early .
I've almost missed the time he requested .
I'll bring you to him .
I know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble , but that doesn't mean it's not a trouble just the same .
The work we enjoy is not really work .
This is the door .
I'll wake him , because that's my job .
Is the king leaving here today ?
He is .
He told us to arrange it .
The night has been chaotic .
The wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
The owl made noise all night .
Some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
It was a rough night .
I'm too young to remember anything like it .
Oh , horror , horror , horror !
This is beyond words and beyond belief !
What's the matter ?
The worst thing imaginable has happened .
The life" ?
Do you mean the king ?
Listen to this , King : as soon as we sent those Irish soldiers running for cover , the Norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .
Didn't this frighten our captains , Macbeth and Banquo ?
The new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
To tell you the truth , they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before ; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .
Your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
Take him to the surgeons .
Who is this ?
He looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
Go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
Don't ask me to talk about it .
Go look and then do the talking yourselves .
Wake up , wake up !
Ring the alarm bell .
Murder and treason !
Banquo and Donalbain , Malcolm !
Wake up !
Shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
Get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
Malcolm !
Banquo !
Get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves , and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror .
Speak up and tell me !
If I repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
Oh Banquo , Banquo , the king has been murdered !
How horrible !
What , in our own house ?
Dear Macduff , I beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn't so .
If I had only died an hour before this event I could say I had lived a blessed life .
Everything is a sick joke .
The graceful and renowned king is dead .
The wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
What's wrong ?
You are , but you don't know it yet .
The source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
Your royal father is murdered .
Who did it ?
It seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
Their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
So were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
They stared at us in confusion .
No one's life should have been entrusted to them .
And yet I still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
What did you do that for ?
Is it possible to be wise , bewildered , calm , furious , loyal , and neutral all at once ?
Then right next to him I saw the murderers , dripping with blood , their daggers rudely covered in gore .
Who could have restrained himself , who loved Duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
Help me out of here , quickly !
Take care of the lady .
Right now we're shaken up by fears and doubts .
I'm putting myself in God's hands , and with his help I plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .
So will I .
So will we all .
Let's get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
Agreed .
What are you going to do ?
Let's not stay here with them .
It's easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
I'm going to England .
I'll go to Ireland .
We'll both be safer if we go separate ways .
Wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
Our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
We haven't yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
There's good reason to escape when there's no mercy to be found anymore .
I can remember the past seventy years pretty well , and in all that time I have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
The clock says it's daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
They say the horses ate each other .
I saw it with my own eyes .
Here comes the good Macduff .
How are things going now ?
Can't you see for yourself ?
The servants Macbeth killed .
They were paid to betray their master .
Malcolm and Donalbain , the king's two sons , have run away and fled , which makes them the prime suspects .
Everything about this is unnatural !
Then it looks like Macbeth will become king .
He has already been named king and has left for Scone to be crowned .
Where is Duncan's body ?
It was carried to Colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors , where their bones are kept safe .
Are you going to Scone ?
No , cousin , I'm going to Fife .
Well , I'll go to Scone .
I hope things go well there .
Good-bye !
Farewell , old man .
May God's blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good , and enemies into friends !
But it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants , and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead .
If the witches tell the truth , which they did about you , maybe what they said about me will come true too .
But shhh !
I'll shut up now .
Whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
Are you going riding this afternoon ?
Yes , my good lord .
We would have liked to have heard your good advice , which has always been serious and helpful , at the council today , but we'll wait until tomorrow .
Are you riding far ?
I'm going far enough that I'll be riding from now until dinner .
Unless my horse goes faster than expected , I will be back an hour or two after sunset .
Don't miss our feast .
My lord , I won't miss it .
But we can talk more about that tomorrow , when we'll discuss matters of state that concern us both .
Hurry up and get to your horse .
Good-bye , until you return tonight .
Is Fleance going with you ?
Yes , my good lord .
It's time we hit the road .
Farewell .
Everybody may do as they please until seven o'clock tonight .
In order to make your company even more enjoyable , I'm going to keep to myself until suppertime .
Until then , God be with you !
Bring them to me .
I'm very afraid of Banquo .
He has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
I'm not afraid of anyone but him .
Then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
Who's there !
God save the king !
Great happiness !
So now Sweno , the Norwegian king , wants a treaty .
We told him we wouldn't even let him bury his men until he retreated to Saint Colme's Inch and paid us ten thousand dollars .
Go announce that he will be executed , and tell Macbeth that Cawdor's titles will be given to him .
I'll get it done right away .
The thane of Cawdor has lost what the noble Macbeth has won .
Now go to the door and stay there until I call for you .
Wasn't it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
It was yesterday , your highness .
Well , did you think about what I said ?
I explained how you were deceived , how you were thwarted , the things that were used against you , who was working against you , and a lot of other things that would convince even a half-wit or a crazy person to say , "Banquo did it ! " You explained it all .
I did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
Are you so patient and forgiving that you're going to let him off the hook ?
Are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?
We are men , my lord .
Just as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , mutts , shaggy lapdogs , swimming dogs , and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs .
It's the same with men .
Now , if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn't down at the very bottom , tell me .
Because if that's the case , I will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
You both know Banquo was your enemy .
It's true , my lord .
We'll do what you want us to , my lord .
Though our lives , We have decided , my lord .
We're in .
I'll call for you soon .
Stay inside .
The deal is closed .
Banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight's the night .
Has Banquo left the court ?
Yes , madam , but he'll be back tonight .
Go tell the king I want to talk to him for a few minutes .
No problem , madam .
If you get what you want and you're still not happy , you've spent everything and gained nothing .
It's better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety .
What's going on , my lord ?
What's done is done .
We have slashed the snake but not killed it .
It will heal and be as good as new , and we'll be threatened by its fangs once again .
We killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
After that , nothing can hurt him further , not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
Come on , relax , dear .
That's exactly what I'll do , my love , and I hope you'll do the same .
You have to stop talking like this .
You know that Banquo and his son Fleance are still alive .
That's comforting .
So be cheerful .
Before the bat flies through the castle , and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it's nighttime , a dreadful deed will be done .
What are you going to do ?
He who chooses me will get what many men want." What many men want , that "many" could mean that most people are fools and choose by whatever is flashy .
So I won't choose what many men desire , because I won't jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population .
So I guess it's you , you silver treasure house .
Tell me once more what you say .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." That's nicely put , because who's going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves ?
No one should have an honor he doesn't deserve .
Oh , wouldn't it be great if property , rank , official positions , and other honors were earned only by merit , not by corruption ?
How many people who are humble now would be great then ?
How many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
Well , let me get back to my choice .
He who chooses me will get what he deserves." I'll assume I deserve the very best. , Give me a key for this one .
You thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
What's this ?
I'll read it. , It looks so unlike Portia !
The one who chooses me will get what he deserves" !
Didn't I deserve anything more than a fool's head ?
Is this my prize ?
Don't I deserve more than this ?
What does this say ?
This box was tested in the fire seven times .
Some people kiss shadows .
They only feel the shadow of joy .
This choice was as foolish as they are .
Take whatever wife you want to bed with you , You'll have a fool's head forever .
So go away .
I came here with a fool's head on my shoulders and now I'm leaving with two. , Goodbye , sweet lady .
I'll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
This is how the candle burned the moth .
Oh , these fools !
When they choose , they only know how to lose .
You know what they say .
Destiny chooses when you'll die and who you'll marry .
Come on , close the curtain , Nerissa .
Where's lady Portia ?
Here .
How can I help you , sir ?
I haven't seen such a promising candidate for your love .
Please don't tell me any more .
Come on , Nerissa , I want to go see this man who's come so courteously .
So , what's the news on the Rialto ?
But it's true , I don't want to get all mushy and go on and on , but the good Antonio , the honest Antonio , oh , if I only had a title good enough to match his ! , Come on , get to the point .
What are you saying ?
Well , the point is , he's lost a ship .
I hope that's all he loses .
Let me say "amen" quickly , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer , because here comes the devil , disguised as a Jew .
How's it going , Shylock ?
What's the news among the merchants ?
You knew , no one knew , no one knew as well as you did , about my daughter's plans to run away .
That's true .
I even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
She'll be damned for it .
That's true , if the devil's judging her .
My own flesh and blood turned against me !
A rebel !
No !
Your I mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
But tell us , did you hear anything about Antonio's loss at sea ?
All right , we'll see you at dinnertime .
I must be one of these silent so-called wise men Gratiano's talking about , because he never lets me get a word in .
If you hang around me for two more years , you'll forget the sound of your own voice .
Goodbye .
Thank you .
Is he right ?
Gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in Venice .
You promised to tell me .
That's another bad deal I've made ! , a bankrupt , a spendthrift , who now has to hide his head on the Rialto , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants .
Let him think about his own debt .
He liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
He used to lend money as a favor between Christians ; but now , let him think about his own debt .
But you won't take his flesh if he can't pay .
What's that good for ?
I'll use it for fish bait .
He's laughed at my losses , made fun of my earnings , humiliated my race , thwarted my deals , turned my friends against me , riled up my enemies , and why ?
Because I'm a Jew .
Doesn't a Jew have eyes ?
Doesn't a Jew have hands , bodily organs , a human shape , five senses , feelings , and passions ?
Doesn't a Jew eat the same food , get hurt with the same weapons , get sick with the same diseases , get healed by the same medicine , and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a Christian ?
If you prick us with a pin , don't we bleed ?
If you tickle us , don't we laugh ?
If you poison us , don't we die ?
And if you treat us badly , won't we try to get revenge ?
If we're like you in everything else , we'll resemble you in that respect .
If a Jew offends a Christian , what's the Christian's kind and gentle reaction ?
Revenge .
We've been looking for him everywhere .
Here comes another Jew .
You couldn't find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a Jew .
Hello , Tubal .
Any news from Genoa ?
Did you find my daughter ?
I went to many places where I heard news about her , but I couldn't find her .
Oh , oh , oh !
I never felt it until now , two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
I wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
I wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
You couldn't find out anything about them ?
Why ?
I don't even know how much I'm spending to find them .
Loss upon loss !
Well , other men have bad luck too .
Antonio , as I heard in Genoa , What , what , what ?
Bad luck , bad luck ?
He's had a ship wrecked coming from Tripolis .
Thank God , thank God !
Is it true , is it true ?
I spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
Thank you , Tubal .
Good news , good news !
Ha , ha , heard in Genoa .
I also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in Genoa one night .
Oh , you're sticking a dagger in me !
I'll never see my gold again .
Eighty ducats in one shot !
Eighty ducats !
I came to Venice with a number of Antonio's creditors who say he won't be able to avoid going bankrupt .
I'm very glad about that .
I'll hound him .
I'll torture him .
I'm very glad .
One creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
Damn her !
You're torturing me , Tubal .
That was my turquoise ring !
Leah gave it to me before we were married .
I wouldn't have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
But Antonio's certainly ruined .
That's true , that's very true .
With him out of Venice , I can make whatever bargains I want when I lend money. , Go , Tubal .
Meet me at the synagogue .
Let me choose now .
I feel tortured by all this talking .
Tortured ,
They're as opposite as hot and cold .
Promise me you'll let me live , and I'll confess the truth .
All right then , confess and live .
Confess and love" is more like it .
But let me try my luck on the boxes .
Go ahead , then .
I'm locked in one of them .
If you really love me , you'll find me. , Nerissa and the rest of you , get away from him .
Play some music while he chooses .
Then if he loses , it'll be his swan song , music before the end .
What music should we play then ?
We've all come out to see what will happen. , Go , Hercules !
If you survive , I'll live .
I'm more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
Ding , dong , bell .
How many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like Hercules or Mars , the god of war ?
Curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
A lovely , cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea , just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty .
So I'll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box , it's like the gold that Midas couldn't eat .
Since this prize is yours , Be happy with it , and don't look for a new one .
If you're happy with what you've won And accept this prize as your blissful destiny , Then turn to where your lady is , And claim her with a loving kiss."
A nice message .
My lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
And so , beautiful lady , I'm standing here just like that , wondering whether all this can be true until you tell me it is .
You see me standing here , Lord Bassanio .
Though I wouldn't wish to be better for my own sake , for your sake I wish I were twenty times more than myself , a thousand times more beautiful and ten thousand times richer , just so you might value me more , so my good qualities , beauty , possessions , and friends would be more than you could calculate .
I'm even happier that I'm not stupid , and I can learn .
I'm happiest of all that I'm yours now , my lord , my king , and you can guide me as you wish .
Everything I am and everything I have now belongs to you .
Just a minute ago I was the owner of this beautiful mansion , master of these servants , and queen over myself .
But as of right this second all these things are yours .
With this ring I give them all to you .
Please let me know your plan , Bassanio .
As long as it's honorable , you can be sure that I'll let you use all my money and do everything I can to help you .
Back when I was a schoolboy , if I lost an arrow I would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction , watching the second arrow more carefully than I had the first .
By risking the second arrow , I'd often get both of them back .
I'm telling you this story for a reason .
I owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid I've lost what I owe you .
But if you'd be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first , I'll watch your arrow more carefully this time .
Just tell me what to do , and I'll do it .
Tell me .
If you see me without it , you can be confident I'm dead .
Now we can shout , "Congratulations , congratulations , my lord and lady ! " My Lord Bassanio , and my dear lady , I wish you all the joy I can wish for .
And when you get married , I hope I can be married at the same time .
Absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
I think I've found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
And do you mean what you're saying , Gratiano ?
Yes , my lord .
Hey , if I lay down my " Welcome , Lorenzo and Salerio .
I do too , my lord .
They're entirely welcome .
That's true , and with good reason .
This letter is for you from Signor Antonio .
Before I open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
He's not sick , my lord , but he's very upset , and his problems are serious .
His letter will tell you how he's doing .
I wish you'd won the Something bad in that letter is making Bassanio turn pale .
Some good friend of his must have died , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much .
What , does the news only get worse ? , Please , Bassanio , I'm half of you , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you .
Oh Portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
My darling , when I gave my love to you , I told you that all the wealth I had ran within my veins , that I have noble blood , but no money .
When I said that , I told you the truth .
But my dear , when I said I was worth nothing , I was actually bragging , I should've said that I was worse than nothing .
Have all his business ventures failed ?
Not even one success ?
Not one , my lord .
Anyway , even if he had the money now , the Jew probably wouldn't take it .
I've never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
He's at the duke's morning and night , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .
When I was still living with him I heard him swear to Tubal and Cush , his countrymen , that he'd rather have Antonio's flesh than twenty times the sum Antonio owed .
And I know that unless the law intervenes , it'll be bad news for poor Antonio .
Is this your good friend who's in so much trouble ?
How much does he owe the Jew ?
Three thousand ducats .
What , that's all ?
Pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
I'll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over .
When it's paid , bring your friend back .
Until you get back , Nerissa and I will live like virgins and widows .
Put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
But let me hear the letter from your friend .
Dear Bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
My creditors are getting mean .
My money's almost run out .
I couldn't pay my debt to the Jew on the due date .
In any case , do what you want .
If your affection for me doesn't convince you to come , don't let my letter do so." Oh , my darling , make your arrangements and go !
Since you're letting me leave , I'll hurry .
But I won't sleep till I get back .
Jailer , watch out for this one .
This is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
Jailer , keep an eye on him .
Listen to me , good Shylock .
I'm going to get my Please , listen to me .
I want my bond .
I won't listen to you .
I want my bond , so stop talking .
I won't be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to Christian meddlers .
Don't follow me .
I'm not talking with you .
I want my bond .
He's the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
Leave him alone .
I won't follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
He wants me dead .
I know the real reason .
I've often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
That's why he hates me .
I'm sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
So go .
I've lost so much weight worrying about my losses have that I'll hardly have a pound of flesh to spare for my bloody creditor tomorrow. , Well , jailer , let's go. , I hope to God that Bassanio comes to see me pay his debt .
Lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
Madam , with all my heart .
I'll do anything you ask .
They'll consider you and Jessica masters of this house in place of Lord Bassanio and myself .
So goodbye until we meet again .
Goodbye , Jessica .
Now , Balthazar , you've always been honest and faithful to me , and I trust you still are .
Sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
Her name is Portia .
I'll meet you at the ferry .
I'll go as fast as I can , madam .
Come on , Nerissa , I have many things to do that you don't even know about yet .
We'll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
Will they see us ?
They will , Nerissa , but we'll be disguised as men .
I'll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think I graduated from school at least a year ago .
I know a thousand immature tricks like that , and I'll use them all .
Why , are we turning to men ?
What kind of question is that !
Here , I'll tell you my whole plan in my carriage , which is waiting for us at the gate .
So hurry up , because we have twenty miles to cover today .
Yes , look , it's true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
That's why I'm worried about you .
I've always been straightforward with you , so now I'm telling you what I think .
Cheer up , because I think you're going to hell .
There's only one hope for you , and even that's a kind of illegitimate hope .
What hope is that , may I ask ?
You can hope your father isn't your real father .
That really is an illegitimate hope .
Then I'd be punished for the sins of my mother .
In that case I'm afraid you're damned by both your father and your mother .
When you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
You're in trouble either way .
My husband will save me .
He's made me a Christian .
He was wrong to do that .
There were enough Christians before , as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
All these new Christians will make the price of hogs go up .
If we're all pork-eaters , we won't be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon , even if we've got the money for it .
I'll tell my husband what you've said , Launcelot .
Here he comes .
You're going to make me jealous , Launcelot , if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
No , you don't need to worry about us , Lorenzo .
Launcelot and I can't agree on anything .
He says I won't get into heaven because I'm a Jew's daughter , and he says you're irresponsible because by converting Jews to Christianity you're raising the price of pork .
I can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with Portia's African servant .
The It's too bad there's more of the Moor than there ought to be .
I think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence , and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do .
That's already been done , sir .
They're all ready to eat dinner .
Good Lord , what a clown you are !
Are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
About the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
As for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
As for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
Oh , he's good at bending words around !
Anyway , how are you , Jessica ?
And how do you like Lord Bassanio's wife ?
I like her more than I can say .
And if he doesn't deserve this joy on earth , he'll never deserve it in heaven .
The poor rude world doesn't have her equal .
As good a wife as she is , that's how good a husband I am to you .
First let's go to dinner .
No , let me say some good things about you while I'm in the mood .
No , please , save it for dinner conversation .
Is Antonio here ?
Yes , sir , I'm here .
I feel sorry for you .
You've come to face a ruthless enemy , an inhuman wretch incapable of pity , without any feelings of mercy .
They tell me you've done everything you can to talk him out of what he's doing .
I'm ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
One of you go call the Jew into court here .
He's standing ready outside the door .
Here he comes , my lord .
We all expect a nice answer from you , Jew .
I've told you what I intend to do , and I've sworn by the holy Sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
If you refuse to allow me to do so , your city's charter and its freedom are endangered .
You're going to ask me why I'd rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
I won't answer that .
Is that enough of an answer ?
What if I had a rat in my house , and I felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
Do you have your answer yet ?
Some men don't like roast pig , others go crazy if they see a cat , and others can't help urinating when they hear bagpipes .
So , to answer your question .
It doesn't excuse your cruel behavior .
I don't have to give you answers that you like .
Does everyone kill what they don't love ?
What , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
You might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his Jewish heart .
I would choose to take my penalty .
How can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don't give any now ?
Why should I be afraid of your judgment when I haven't done anything wrong ?
Many of you own slaves , which , like your donkeys and dogs and mules , you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .
Should I say to you , "Set them free !
Let them marry your children !
Why are you making them work so hard ?
Let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you" ?
No , you'd answer , "The slaves are ours." And that's just how I'm answering you .
The pound of flesh that I want from him was very expensive .
It's mine and I'm going to get it .
If you refuse me , the laws of Venice have no validity .
I await justice .
Oh Nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
But as far as I can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
The best way to be happy is to be in between .
Good point , and well said .
It would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
It takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
But thinking like this won't help me choose a husband .
Isn't it a pain that I can't choose or refuse anyone , Nerissa ?
I have the authority to dismiss this court , unless Bellario comes today .
Bring us the letters .
Call the messenger in .
Cheer up , Antonio !
Keep up your courage , man !
I'll give the Jew my flesh , blood , bones , and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me .
I'm like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
The weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
Bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
Have you come from Bellario's office in Padua ?
Yes , my lord .
Bellario sends his greetings .
To cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
You're sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel Jew .
No metal , not even the executioner's axe , could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
Can't any prayers reach your heart ?
No , none that you're smart enough to make .
You make me want to agree with the philosopher Pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies .
That's why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
Unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract , you're just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
Be quiet , boy , or you'll lose your mind .
I stand here with the law on my side .
This letter from Bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
Where is he ?
He's waiting nearby to find out if you'll invite him in .
With all my heart. , Three or four of you go welcome him. , In the meantime , I'll read Bellario's letter out loud .
His name is Balthazar .
I leave him to you .
Did old Bellario send you here ?
Yes , my lord .
Welcome .
Please have a seat .
Are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
Yes , thoroughly .
Antonio and Shylock , both of you come forward .
Is your name Shylock ?
Shylock is my name .
Your case is most unusual , though the Venetian law can't stop you from proceeding. , Yes , so he says .
Do you acknowledge the contract ?
Yes , I do .
Then the Jew must show you mercy .
Why do I have to do that ?
Tell me .
No one shows mercy because he has to .
It just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
It blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
It's strongest in the strongest people .
It looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
Kingly power seems most like God's power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
If you pursue it , this strict court of Venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .
I take all responsibility for my decisions .
I want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
Can't he pay back the money ?
If that's not enough , I'll sign a contract to pay ten times that much , and I'll give you my hands , my head , and my heart as security .
There's no power in Venice that can change an established decree .
The change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
That can't happen .
Please , let me review the contract .
Shylock , they're offering you three times the money you lent .
But I made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
Should I perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
No , not for all of Venice .
And so the Jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant's heart , to be cut off by him. , But please have mercy .
Take three times your money .
Tell me to tear up this contract .
I'll tear it up when it's paid .
You seem like a good judge .
You know the law .
I urge you to deliver your verdict .
I swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
I'm sticking to the contract .
I beg the court to deliver the verdict .
Well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
Oh , good judge !
Oh , you excellent young man !
The law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
Very true .
Oh wise judge !
You're so much older than you look !
Yes , his chest !
Nearest his heart." , Those are the very words .
Yes .
Is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
I have it ready .
Pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds , Shylock , so he doesn't bleed to death .
Is that called for in the contract ?
Not explicitly , but so what ?
It wouldn't hurt you to be charitable .
I can't find it .
It's not in the contract .
Not much .
I'm ready and waiting. , Give me your hand , Bassanio .
Goodbye .
Don't be sad that this happened because of you , because Lady Luck's been nicer to me than usual .
Be sad only at the fact that you'll lose your friend , your friend doesn't regret that he paid your debt .
If the Jew cuts deep enough , I'll pay it instantly with all my heart .
Antonio , I married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
But life itself , my wife , and the whole world aren't more valuable to me than your life is .
I'd give it all up , yes , I'd sacrifice them all to this devil here , to save you .
Your wife wouldn't like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
I have a wife I love .
I wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog Jew change his mind .
It's nice you're offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
That's what you get for marrying Christian husbands .
I have a daughter .
The court awards it and the law authorizes it .
What a righteous judge !
And you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
The law allows it , and the court awards it .
What a wise judge !
Come on , get ready .
But wait a moment .
There's something else .
This contract doesn't give you any blood at all .
The words expressly specify "a pound of flesh." So take your penalty of a pound of flesh , but if you shed one drop of Christian blood when you cut it , the state of Venice will confiscate your land and property under Venetian law .
Is that the law ?
You can see for yourself .
You asked for justice , so rest assured you'll get more justice than you bargained for .
Pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the Christian go .
Here is the money .
Wait !
The Jew will have justice .
Wait , don't rush !
He's not getting anything except the penalty .
So get ready to cut off the flesh .
Don't shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
If you take more or less than exactly a pound , even if it's just the tiniest fraction of an ounce , if the scale changes by even so much as a hair , you die , and all your property will be confiscated .
A second Daniel ! , A Daniel , Jew !
I've got you now , pagan .
Why is the Jew waiting ?
Take your penalty .
Give me my money and let me go .
I have it ready for you .
Here it is .
Your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
But tell me .
Well , first there was the prince from Naples .
I'm afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
Then there's the Count Palatine .
He does nothing but frown , as if he wants to say , "If you don't want me , I don't care." He doesn't even smile when he hears funny stories .
If he's so sad and solemn when he's young , I can only imagine how much he'll cry as an old man .
No , I'd rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men .
God protect me from these two !
What did you think about that French lord , Monsieur le Bon ?
No , he refused it publicly , in open court .
He will have only justice and his penalty .
You can't have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , Jew .
Well , then , I hope he chokes on it !
I'm not staying here to argue anymore .
Wait a minute , Jew .
The law has another hold on you .
The laws of Venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner's goods .
The other half goes to the state .
So get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
So you'll be hanged at the state's expense .
I want you to see the difference between us , so I pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
Half of your wealth goes to Antonio .
The other half goes to the state .
Yes , the state's half can be reduced , but not Antonio's .
No , go ahead and take my life .
Don't pardon that .
You take my house away when you take the money I need for upkeep .
You take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
What mercy can you show him , Antonio ?
Nothing else , for God's sake !
If the duke and his court agree to set aside the fine for one half of his property , I'm happy , as long as he lets me have the other half in trust , to give it to the gentleman who recently stole his daughter .
Second , he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law Lorenzo and his daughter when he dies .
He must do this , or I'll recant the pardon I just delivered .
Are you satisfied , Jew ?
What do you say ?
I'm satisfied .
Please let me go .
I'm not well .
Send the deed after me and I'll sign it .
Go , but sign the deed .
I should really leave right away .
I'm sorry you don't have time. , Antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
We owe you love and service forever .
Being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
In saving you I consider myself well paid .
My thoughts were never on money .
I hope you'll recognize me when we meet again .
I wish you well .
Take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
This ring , sir , oh no , it's nothing .
I'd be ashamed to give you this .
I don't want anything but that .
Now that I think about it , I really want it .
There's more to this ring than its cash value .
I'll give you the most expensive ring in Venice , and I'll make a public announcement to help me find it .
But as for this ring , please excuse me .
I see you like to make big offers , sir .
First you taught me how to beg , and now I think you're teaching me how a beggar should be answered .
Good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
When she put it on my finger , she made me swear never to sell it , give it away , or lose it .
Many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
If your wife's not a madwoman , and you tell her how much I deserve this ring , she won't stay angry at you forever if you give it to me .
Well , anyway , goodbye .
Bassanio , let him have the ring .
Come on , you and I will go soon .
Early in the morning we'll both rush to Belmont .
Come on , Antonio .
Find out where the Jew's house is .
Give him this deed and have him sign it .
We'll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
Lorenzo will be happy with what we've done .
And could you please take my servant to old Shylock's house ?
I'll do that .
Go , hurry .
You know where I'll be waiting .
The moon's bright tonight .
I think that on a night like this , when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn't make a sound , On a night like this , On a night like this , On a night like this ,
On a night like this , young Lorenzo swore he loved her very much , stealing her heart with vows of love , but not one vow was true .
On a night like this , pretty Jessica , in a bad mood , said outrageously wrong things about her lover , and he forgave her .
I hear his footsteps .
Who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
A friend .
A friend ?
What friend ?
What's your name , please , friend ?
My name's Stephano , and I've come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at Belmont before sunrise .
She's still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
Who's coming with her ?
No one except her maid and a holy hermit .
Has my master returned yet ?
Hey , hey !
Hey !
Yoo-hoo !
Who's shouting ?
Hey !
Have you seen Master Lorenzo !
Stop hollering , man !
I'm here .
Hey !
Where , where ?
Here .
Tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
My master will be here in the morning .
My dear , let's go inside and wait for them to arrive .
But I guess it doesn't matter .
We might as well call him a man , since God created him .
His horse is better than the Neapolitan's and he frowns more than the Count Palatine .
What about Falconbridge , that young English baron ?
I have no opinion about him .
He doesn't speak Latin , French , or Italian , and you know how little English I speak .
He's great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn't speak your language ?
He was dressed so oddly too !
I think he got his jacket in Italy , his tights in France , his hat in Germany , and his behavior everywhere .
What do you think of his neighbor , the Scottish lord ?
How beautiful the moonlight's shining on this bank !
Let's sit here and let the music fill our ears .
Stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
Sit down , Jessica .
Look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
Wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
Get her attention and draw her home with music .
I'm never in the mood to laugh when I hear sweet music .
His soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
Nobody like that should be trusted .
Pay attention to the music .
That light we see is coming from my hall .
Look how far that little candle sends its light !
That's the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
While the moon was shining we didn't even notice the candle .
Well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
A governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by , and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
Music , listen !
It's your music , madam , from your house .
Now I see that you can't call anything good except in right context .
How many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
Quiet now !
Look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can't be awoken !
If I'm not mistaken , that's Portia's voice .
He recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo , by its bad voice .
Dear lady , welcome home .
We've been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
Have they come back ?
Go inside , Nerissa .
Tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
I hear his trumpet .
I think this night is just like sick daylight .
It only looks a little paler .
It looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
I'll give Thank you , darling .
I'd like to introduce you to my friend .
This is Antonio , my dearest friend .
Sir , welcome to our house .
But action speaks louder than words , so I'll cut short these polite words .
What , an argument already ?
What's the matter ?
It said , "Love me and don't leave me." How can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring ?
You swore to me when I gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
And now you claim you gave it to a judge's clerk !
He will if he lives long enough to become a man .
Yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
I didn't have the heart to say no to him .
You were wrong to give away your wife's first gift so thoughtlessly , a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .
I gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
And here he is .
I'd swear he wouldn't leave it behind , or even take it off his finger , for all the money in the world .
To tell the truth , Gratiano , you're giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
If it were me , I'd be very upset too .
Bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
And then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
Neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
Which ring did you give away , my lord ?
Not the one I gave you , I hope .
If I could make things better by lying , I'd deny it .
But you see my finger doesn't have the ring on it .
It's gone .
My dear Portia , if you knew who I gave the ring to , for whose sake I gave the ring to him , why I gave it to him , and how unwilling I was to leave it when he wouldn't accept anything but the ring , you wouldn't be so angry .
If you'd known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you wouldn't have let it go .
Nerissa's got the right idea .
I'll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
What could I say , my dear ?
I had to send it to him .
Don't let that lawyer ever come near my house !
Since he has the jewel I loved , which you swore you'd keep forever , I'll be as generous as you were to him .
I won't deny him anything of mine , including my own body and my husband's bed .
I'll recognize him all right , I'm sure of it .
So don't spend one night away from this house .
Watch me like a hawk .
If you don't , if I'm left alone , I swear I'll have that legal expert as my bedfellow .
All these quarrels are about me .
Don't be upset .
All these friends are my witnesses , so I swear to you , I swear by your beautiful eyes , in which I see myself reflected , Did you hear that !
He sees himself in my two eyes , so there's two of him .
He should swear by his two-faced self , and that's an oath I'll believe !
No , just listen to me .
If you forgive my mistake , I swear I'll never break an oath with you again .
I lent my body once to make him rich .
My God , it's the same one I gave the judge !
I got it from him .
What , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
Don't be crass. , You all look confused .
I'm speechless .
Yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
Madam , you've given me life and given me a living too .
How did you like the young German , the duke of Saxony's nephew ?
He's pretty awful in the morning when he's sobering up , and even worse in the afternoon when he's drunk .
At his best he's a little less than a man , and at his worst he's little more than an animal .
I'll do anything rather than marry a drunk , Nerissa .
You don't have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
I wish them all safe trips home .
Do you remember a Venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of Montferrat here once when your father was still alive ?
How are you , Lorenzo ?
My clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
Yes , and I'll give it to him for free .
Ladies , you're dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
It's almost morning , but I'm sure you're not fully satisfied about what happened .
Let's go inside and we'll answer all your questions truthfully .
All right , then .
My first question for Nerissa is whether she'd rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now , since there are only two more hours till morning .
When the day comes , I'll wish it were nighttime , so I could sleep with the legal expert's clerk .
Yes , madam , that's the one .
He deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men I've ever seen .
I remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
Hello , do you have any news ?
The four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
And there's a messenger representing a fifth one , the prince of Morocco , who says the prince will be here tonight .
If I could say hello to the fifth one as happily as I'll say goodbye to the first four , I'd be very happy he's coming .
If he's as good as a saint but is black like a devil , I'd rather he hear my confession than marry me .
Let's go , Nerissa. ,
Three thousand ducats , hmmm .
Yes , for three months .
For three months , hmmm .
As I said before , Antonio will guarantee the loan .
If I default , he'll pay you .
Antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
Can you help me ?
What's your answer ?
Three thousand ducats for three months , and Antonio will guarantee it .
Your answer ?
Antonio's a good man .
Have you heard anything to the contrary ?
But his investments are uncertain right now .
He has one ship bound for Tripoli , another heading for the Indies .
What's more , people at the
But ships are just fragile boards , and sailors are just men .
There are rats and thieves and pirates , not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
But in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
I assure you he can .
Oh yes , to smell This is Signor Antonio .
To be honest , I don't know why I'm so sad .
I'm tired of it , and you say you're tired of it too .
I'd be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
Everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
Shylock , are you listening ?
If I remember correctly , I can't raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
But so what ?
Tubal , a wealthy Jew I know , will supply me with the cash .
But wait a minute !
How many months do you want ?
Shylock , although I never lend or borrow with interest , I'm willing to break that habit to help a friend in need .
Oh yes , three thousand ducats .
For three months .
Yes , I forgot , three months .
That's right .
That's not how I do business .
When Jacob took care of his uncle Laban's sheep , Jacob was the heir to his grandfather Abraham's birthright , because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband Isaac to make Jacob his heir , What's your point ?
Did he charge interest ?
Jacob didn't have any control over what happened .
That your interest payments are like Jacob's sheep ?
But listen to me , signor ,
An evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
Oh , liars can look so honest !
Three months from twelve months of the year .
Let me see .
The interest rate will be , Well , Shylock ?
Signor Antonio , you've often insulted my money and my business practices in the Rialto .
And all because I use my own money to make a profit .
And now it looks like you need my help .
All right then .
You come to me saying , "Shylock , we need money." You say that ! , even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you'd kick a stray mutt out your front door .
And now you're asking for money .
What can I tell you ?
Shouldn't I say , "Does a dog have money ?
Is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats ? " Or should I bend down low , and in a humble and submissive voice say :
If you're going to lend us this money , don't lend it to us as if we were your friends .
Instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
Look at you getting all riled up !
I want to be friends with you , and forget all the times you've embarrassed and humiliated me .
I'm making a kind offer , zero percent financing .
That really would be kind .
I'll show you how kind I am .
If you don't repay me on the day we agree on , in the place we name , for the sum of money fixed in our contract , your penalty will be a pound of your pretty flesh , to be cut off and taken out of whatever part of your body I like .
It's a deal .
I'll agree to those terms and even say that Jews are nice .
No , you can't sign a contract like that for me !
I'd rather go without the money .
In two months , a month before this loan is due , I expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments .
A pound of human flesh taken isn't even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
If he agrees , great .
If not , goodbye .
And I hope you won't think badly of me .
Yes , Shylock , I'll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
Then meet me right away at the notary's .
Give him the instructions for our amusing little contract , and I'll go get the money for you right away .
Hurry up , my Jewish friend .
My ships will come home a month before the money is due .
I wouldn't change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
Thank you for saying that .
Show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
I swear by my sword , which killed the Shah of Persia and a Persian prince and defeated the Sultan Suleiman three times , that I would face the meanest-looking warriors on earth .
But this is bad !
Think about it carefully .
Let me take my chances .
Let's go to the temple first .
You can take your chances after dinner .
I'm sure I'll feel guilty if I run away from this Jew , my master .
Be tough , " says the devil , "and run ! " But then my conscience , hanging around my heart , says very wisely to me , "My good friend Launcelot , you're a good boy , the son of an honest man , " really , that should be the son of an honest woman , since my father cheated on my mother .
Anyway , my conscience says , "Stay put." "Go , " the devil says .
Don't go , " says my conscience .
Conscience , " I say , "you give good advice." "Devil , " I say , "you give good advice." If I listened to my conscience , I'd stay with the Jew my master , who's a devil .
But if I ran away from the Jew , I'd be following the advice of the devil , who's the very devil himself .
The devil's advice is nicer .
I'll run , devil .
Tell me to run , and I'll run .
Excuse me , young man , how do I get to the Jew's residence ?
Young man , excuse me , how do I get to the Jew's ?
Turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
Oh , and then at the very next turn , don't turn left or right , but turn down and around to the Jew's house .
Good heavens , those are difficult directions .
Can you tell me if a man named Launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
Are you talking about young Master Launcelot ?
He's not a "master , " sir , he's just a poor man's son .
His father , if I do say so myself , is an honest but very poor man , and , thank God , likely to live a long time .
He's just Launcelot .
Who wouldn't get sad thinking about things like that ?
It's obvious .
No , that's not it , trust me .
So it's not my business that's making me sad .
Well then , you must be in love .
You're not in love either ?
But excuse me , Yes , I'm talking about Launcelot , sir .
Oh , no .
God forbid !
The boy was going to support me in my old age !
What am I , a cane ?
Don't you recognize me , father ?
Heaven help me , I don't know you , sir .
But please tell me , is my boy , God rest his soul , alive or dead ?
You really don't recognize me , father ?
Sir , I'm half-blind .
I don't know you .
Even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
It takes a wise father to know his own child .
Well , old man , I'll tell you news of your son .
Give me your blessing .
Please stand up !
I'm sure you aren't Launcelot , my boy .
Give me your blessing .
I'm Launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
I can't believe you're my son .
Yes , you're right , her name is Margery .
If you're Launcelot , then you're my own flesh and blood .
Then Dobbin's tail must be growing backward .
I'm sure he had more hair on his tail than I have on my face when I last saw him .
Lord , how you've changed !
How are you and your master getting along ?
I've brought him a present .
How are you ?
My master's a total Jew .
You're giving him a present ?
Give him a noose to hang himself .
He's starving me to death .
You can see my ribs so well you can count them .
I'm glad you've come , father .
Give me your present to give to Master Bassanio .
Thank you .
What do you want with me ?
What do you want ?
To work for you , sir .
That's what we're trying to say , sir .
I know who you are .
You can have what you want .
Father , go ahead .
BASSANIO Please , Leonardo , think about this I'll do my best .
He's walking over there , sir .
Signor Bassanio !
Gratiano !
I have a favor to ask .
Anything .
Don't say no .
Let me go with you to Belmont .
Well , if you have to go , you have to go .
But listen to me , Gratiano .
Sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
Please , try to act a little more serious , or the people in Belmont will get the wrong impression about me , and your wildness will make me blow my chance with Portia .
Listen , Signor Bassanio , there's nothing to worry about .
I'll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet , even more .
If I don't do all this , never trust me again .
Well , we'll see how you act .
Okay , but tonight doesn't count .
You can't judge me based on what I do tonight .
I'd rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
Anyway , I have to say goodbye to you now .
I've got some business to take care of .
I'm sorry you're leaving my father like this .
It's hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
You'll soon be meeting Lorenzo at supper ; he'll be a guest of your new master .
Give him this letter .
Goodbye .
I'm sure some Christian will resort to trickery to get you .
But goodbye .
It's not manly to cry .
Goodbye .
Goodbye , Launcelot .
Oh God , what a heinous sinner I am , being ashamed to be my father's child !
But I need to remember I'm related to him by blood , not behavior .
Oh Lorenzo , if you keep your promise to me , I'll end this agony by becoming a Christian and marrying you .
No , we'll sneak away at supper time , disguise ourselves with masks at my house , and come back in an hour .
But we haven't made any preparations .
We haven't even talked about who'll be our torchbearers .
I think it's better to call it off .
It's only four o'clock now .
We have two hours to get ready .
Launcelot , what's going on ?
I recognize the handwriting .
I bet it's a love letter !
Where are you going ?
To invite my former boss , the Jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the Christian .
Me too .
Meet me and Gratiano at his house in about an hour .
It's good we're doing this .
Wasn't that letter from Jessica ?
Some people will laugh at anything , and others are so grouchy they won't even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny .
Goodbye , then .
You're both very precious to me .
You need to leave to take care of your own business .
We're available .
Bassanio , we'll say goodbye for now , since you've found Antonio .
Don't worry , I'll be there .
I have to tell you everything .
Who asked you to call her ?
I'm not asking you to call her .
You always loved to tell me I couldn't do anything without being told .
Did you call me ?
Do you need something ?
I've been invited to supper , Jessica .
Here are my keys. , But why should I go ?
I wasn't invited because they like me .
They're just flattering me .
But I'll go out of spite , to feed off the wasteful Christian. , Jessica , my girl , watch the house .
I don't feel like going .
I know because I dreamed of money bags last night .
Please go , sir .
My new master is expecting your approach .
And I'm expecting his reproach .
And they've been plotting things together .
I knew there would be a masquerade when I got that bad omen of a bloody nose last Easter Monday , at six in the morning , four years after I got the same kind of bloody nose on Ash Wednesday , in the afternoon .
What , there's going to be a masquerade ?
Don't stick your head out into the public street to stare at the Christian fools with painted faces .
Block up my house's ears , I mean the windows .
I'll go ahead of you , sir .
What did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
He said "Goodbye , madam , " and nothing else .
The fool's nice enough , but he's such a huge eater , and slow as a snail when he works .
He sleeps all day like a cat .
Anyway , Jessica , go inside .
I might come back soon .
Do as I told you .
Shut the doors after you .
Goodbye .
If luck's with me , I'll lose a father , and you'll lose a daughter .
This is the roof under which Lorenzo said to meet him .
He's late .
Yes , and that's surprising , because lovers are usually early .
Yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who've been married forever .
That's always true .
Who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down ?
Can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
We chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
Here comes Lorenzo .
We'll talk about this later .
My dear friends , thanks for your patience .
I had business that made me late .
When you have to steal your own wives some day , I'll wait for you just as long .
Come over here .
Who's in there ?
Who are you ?
Tell me so I can be sure , though I swear I recognize your voice .
I'm Lorenzo , your love .
Lorenzo , that's for sure , and I'm also sure you're my love , who else do I love so much ?
And now who but you knows whether I'm yours ?
As God is my witness , you know you're mine .
Here , catch this box .
It'll be worth your while .
You have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
What , I have to hold a candle up so people can see what I'm doing ?
I'll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
My God , she can't be a Jew , she's too nice !
God , I'm crazy about her .
She's wise , if I'm judging her right .
She's beautiful , if my eyes can see .
And she's loyal , as she has proven .
And as long as she's herself , wise , beautiful , and faithful , she'll always have a place in my heart .
Ah , you're here ? , Come on , gentlemen , let's go !
Our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
Who's there ?
Signor Antonio ?
It's nine o'clock !
Our friends are all waiting for you .
There's no masquerade tonight .
I've sent twenty people to look for you .
I'm glad .
I want to head out tonight .
One of them contains my picture .
If you choose that one , I'm yours , along with the picture .
I wish some god could help me choose !
Let me see .
I'll look over the inscriptions again .
What does the lead box say ?
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." Must give everything , for what ?
For lead ?
Risk everything for lead ?
This box is too threatening .
Men who risk everything hope to make profits .
A golden mind doesn't bend down to choose something worthless .
So I won't give or risk anything for lead .
What does the silver one say ?
He who chooses me will get as much as he deserves." As much as he deserves , wait a minute there , Morocco , and consider your own value with a level head .
What if I went no further and chose this one ?
But let's see once more what the gold one says : "He who chooses me will get what many men want." That's Portia !
The whole world wants her .
They come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living , breathing saint .
Princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of Arabia to come see the beautiful Portia .
The wide ocean doesn't prevent them from coming to see her , they travel across it as if it were a little stream .
One of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
Could the lead one contain it ?
No , it'd be a sin to think such a low thought .
Lead's too crass to hold her .
Is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
Oh , what a sinful thought !
Nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
They have a coin in England stamped with the figure of an angel , but that's just engraved on the surface .
You don't look well , Antonio .
People with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
I'd rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
I'll talk to you more about this some other time .
I'm a fool. , Let's go , Lorenzo. , Goodbye for now .
I'll finish my lecture after dinner .
Here an angel's lying in a golden bed. , Give me the key .
I will choose this one and try my chances .
Damn it !
What's this ?
It's a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
I'll read it aloud .
All that glitters is not gold , You've often heard that said .
Many men have sold their souls Just to view my shiny surface .
But gilded tombs contain worms .
If you'd been as wise as you were bold , With an old man's mature judgment , You wouldn't have had to read this scroll .
Portia , goodbye to you .
My heart's too sad for long goodbyes .
Losers always leave quickly .
Good riddance ! , Close the curtains and leave. , I hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
I saw Bassanio sail away , and Gratiano went with him .
I'm sure Lorenzo isn't on their ship .
That wicked Jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
The duke went with him to search Bassanio's ship .
He got there too late .
The ship was already sailing .
But once he got there , the duke learned that Lorenzo and his lover Jessica were together in a gondola .
In any case , Antonio assured the duke they weren't with Bassanio on his ship .
I've never heard such confused emotions as what that Jew dog was shouting in the streets .
Ran off with a Christian !
Oh my Christian ducats !
Justice , find the girl !
She has the stones on her , and the ducats." I know , all the boys in Venice are following him , yelling , "His stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! "
I hope Antonio repays his loan on time , or he'll suffer for this .
That's a good point .
I spoke with a Frenchman yesterday who said that a Venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the English Channel .
You should tell Antonio what you hear , but don't do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
I saw Bassanio and Antonio say goodbye .
Bassanio told him he'd try to hurry back .
As for the Jew's contract , don't let it be a factor in your plans .
Then he shook Bassanio's hand affectionately , and they separated .
I think he only loves life because of Bassanio .
Let's go find him and cheer him up .
Yes , let's do that .
Hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
The prince of Arragon has taken his oath , and he's coming to make his choice now .
Look , here are the boxes , prince .
If you choose the one that contains my picture , we'll be married right away .
But if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
Everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
Okay , I'm ready .
I hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
Gold , silver , and common lead .
He who chooses me must give and risk all he has." You'd have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you .
What does the golden box say ?
Hmm , let me see :
We seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
Do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
It's not friendly , and it's not ladylike .
All women would be angry with you for doing it , even though I'm the only one who's hurt by it .
I'm not insulting you .
It sounds more like you're insulting me .
Didn't you send Lysander , as an insult , to follow me around praising my eyes and my face ?
Haven't you made your other love , Demetrius , who kicked me with his foot not long ago , call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
Why does he talk like that to a girl he can't stand ?
And why does Lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
Why does it matter that I'm not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love I feel is unrequited ?
You should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
I don't know what you're talking about .
Oh , fine .
All right , go ahead , keep up your little game , pretend to be sympathetic , but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when I turn my back .
If you had any sense of pity , or manners , you wouldn't pretend to fight over me like this .
But goodbye .
It's partly my own fault , since I followed you here .
Stay , lovely Helena .
Listen to my excuse .
My love , my life , my soul , beautiful Helena !
That's a good one .
You can't force me any more than Hermia can beg me .
Your threats are no stronger than her whining. , Helena , I love you .
I swear I do .
I'll give my life for you , just to prove this guy wrong when he says I don't love you .
I say that I love you more than he does .
If that's what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
Lysander , where are you going with all this ?
Why have you gotten so rude ?
Your darling ?
Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
Get out , you horrible poison .
Get out !
Are you joking ?
Of course he is , and so are you .
Demetrius , I'm ready to fight you as promised .
I wish we had a signed legal contract .
I don't trust you .
Sure , I hate her , but I wouldn't hurt her .
I certainly did , and I never wanted to see you again .
So stop hoping and wondering what I mean .
I've spelled it out for you clearly .
Oh , no !
Oh , that's very nice !
You ought to be ashamed of yourself !
Puppet" ?
Why "puppet" ? , Oh , I see where this is going .
So how short am I , you painted barber pole ?
Tell me .
How short am I ?
Good Hermia , please don't act so bitter toward me .
He followed you .
And I followed him because I loved him .
But he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me , even kill me .
Please let me go .
You see how naive and foolish I've been .
Well , get out of here then !
What's keeping you ?
My stupid heart , which I'm leaving behind here .
What , you're leaving it with Lysander ?
No , with Demetrius .
Don't be afraid .
She can't hurt you , Helena .
She was a hellcat in school .
And she's fierce , even though she's little .
Little" again ?
Nothing but "little" and "short" ! , Why are you letting her insult me like this ?
Let me at her ! .
How are you , my love ? , Demetrius and Egeus , come with us .
I want you to do some things for our wedding , and I also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
We're following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
What's going on , my love ?
Why are you so pale ?
Why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
Probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain , which I could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes .
Oh , honey !
Listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
Either the lovers have different social standings ,
Leave Hermia alone .
Don't talk about Helena .
Don't take Helena's side .
If you continue treating Hermia so badly , you'll pay for it .
Hermia's not holding onto me anymore .
Follow me if you're brave enough , and we'll fight over Helena .
Follow" ?
No , I'll walk right next to you , side by side .
All this fighting is because of you .
Stay where you are .
I don't know what to say .
Believe me , King of Illusions , I made a mistake .
Didn't you tell me that I'd be able to recognize the man by the Athenian clothes he was wearing ?
So far I've done exactly what I was supposed to do , I put the love potion on an Athenian's eyes .
And so far I'm pleased with the way things have turned out , since I find all of this commotion very entertaining .
As you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
Hurry up , Robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
Cover the sky with a low-hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can't run into each other .
We've got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
I like the morning .
I often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean , turning the salty green water to gold .
But you should hurry anyway .
Don't delay .
We still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
Up and down , up and down , I will lead them up and down .
The people fear me in the country and the town .
Goblin , lead them up and down .
Here comes one of them now .
Where are you , Demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
Say something .
Lysander , say something !
You coward , did you run away from me ?
Say something !
Are you behind some bush ?
Where are you hiding ?
Are you there ?
He's walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
When I reach the place he's calling from , he disappears .
This villain is much quicker than I am .
I'll rest here .
Where are you now ?
No , you're just taunting me .
You'll pay for this if I ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
Go wherever you want .
Oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
Only three so far ?
We're still waiting for one more .
Two of both kinds makes four .
Ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
Cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
I'll sleep here until morning .
If they do fight , I hope Lysander is safe !
Sleep well there on the ground .
Where's Peaseblossom ?
Here .
Scratch my head , Peaseblossom .
Where's Monsieur Cobweb ?
Here .
Don't tire yourself out , monsieur .
Oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
I'd hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
Where's Monsieur Mustardseed ?
Here .
Give me your first , Mr. Mustardseed .
Please , stop bowing , good sir .
What would you like me to do ?
Nothing , good sir , except to help Sir Cobweb scratch my head .
I should go to the barber's , monsieur , because I think I'm getting really hairy around the face .
And I'm such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little , I need to scratch .
Would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
I have a pretty good ear for music .
Let's hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
Or tell me , my sweet love , what you'd like to eat .
Actually , I'd like a few pounds of grass .
I'd like to munch on some good dry oats .
Or maybe I've got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
There's nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
I have an adventurous fairy who'll go seek out the squirrel's secret stash and get you some fresh nuts .
I'd rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
But please don't let any of your people wake me up .
I really want to sleep now .
Go to sleep , and I will wrap my arms around you .
Oh , how I love you !
I'm so crazy about you !
Welcome , good Robin .
Do you see this sweet sight ?
Now I'm starting to pity Titania for being so infatuated .
I ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and I scolded her and argued with her .
She had put a wreath of fresh , fragrant flowers around his hairy forehead , and the drops of dew that lay in the center of the flowers made the flowers look like they were crying with shame to be decorating the head of that ugly jackass .
And now that I have the boy , I'll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
And , gentle Puck , take this transformed ass's head off of the head of that Athenian man , so that when he wakes up at the same time as the rest of them do , they can all go back to Athens .
But first I'll release the fairy queen from the spell .
Now , Titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
There's your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
How did this happen ?
Oh , I hate looking at his face now !
Be quiet for a while. , Robin , take off his donkey head. , Titania , get the fairies to play some music , and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before .
Music !
Play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
Play the music. , Take my hands , my queen , and we'll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing .
Being too old to marry someone young .
Or else their guardians and advisors said no , What hell , to have your love life determined by someone else !
That's how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
If true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
That's the right attitude .
So , listen , Hermia .
I have an aunt who is a widow , who's very rich and doesn't have any children .
She lives about twenty miles from Athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
I could marry you there , gentle Hermia , where the strict laws of Athens can't touch us .
So here's the plan .
Listen , Fairy King .
I can hear the lark singing .
Morning's here .
While we're walking , you can tell me how I ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night .
One of you go find the forest ranger .
Unleash the dogs in the western valley .
Let them go .
Now go find the forest ranger .
My beautiful queen , we'll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music .
I was with the heroes Hercules and Cadmus once , when their Spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
The forests , the skies , the mountains , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds .
I'd never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
I don't understand why they're all here together .
But tell me , Egeus .
Isn't today the day when Hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she'll marry Demetrius ?
It is , my lord .
Go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
Good morning , my friends .
Valentine's Day is over .
Are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
Forgive us , my lord .
Please , all of you , stand up .
My lord , what I say may be a little confused , since I'm half asleep and half awake .
I swear , at the moment I really couldn't tell you how I ended up here .
But I think , I want to tell you the truth , and now that I think about it , I think this is true , I came here with Hermia .
Now the only person I love , and believe in , and want to look at , is Helena .
I was engaged to her before I ever met Hermia .
You pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
We'll talk more about this later. , Egeus , I'm overriding your wishes .
Come with us to Athens .
We three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
Are you sure we're awake ?
It seems to me like we're still sleeping , still dreaming .
And he told us to follow him to the temple .
Well , then , we're awake .
I'll call it "Bottom's Dream" because it's so deep that it has no bottom .
And I'll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
Or maybe , to make it even more lovely , I'll sing it when the heroine dies .
Have you sent anyone to Bottom's house ?
Has he come home yet ?
No one's heard from him .
I'm sure he's been kidnapped .
If he doesn't show up , the play is ruined .
It won't go on .
Will it ?
No , it would be impossible .
He's quite simply the smartest working-man in Athens .
Yes , and the best looking too .
And his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
You mean "paragon." A The duke's leaving the temple .
Two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
If we'd been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
Oh that great , funny guy , Bottom !
He would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
Six pence a day would've been forced on him .
I'll be damned if the duke wouldn't have given him six pence a day for playing Pyramus .
And he would have deserved it too .
Where are my good fellows ?
Bottom !
Oh , how wonderful to see you !
Oh , what a relief !
I'll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
Tell us , Bottom .
No , you won't get a word out of me .
All I'll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
Now it's time to get your costumes together .
Meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
Look over your lines again .
And no one eat any onions or garlic .
If we have sweet-smelling breath , I'm sure they'll say "it's a sweet play." Now no more talking .
Get busy , go !
These lovers are saying some strange things , Theseus .
I'll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
Lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
Their story is bizarre and astounding , but it's solid and consistent .
Here come the lovers , laughing happily. , I wish you joy , my friends !
Now , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime ?
Where is our entertainment director ?
What performances have been prepared ?
Let me see Philostrate .
Here I am , Theseus .
Which plays , what music ?
How will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
Keep your promise , my love .
Look , here comes Helena .
Hello , beautiful Helena !
Where are you going ?
Did you just call me "beautiful" ?
Take it back .
You're the beautiful one as far as Demetrius is concerned .
Oh , you're so lucky !
Your eyes are like stars , and your voice is more musical than a lark's song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
If the world were mine , I'd give it all up , everything except Demetrius , to be you .
The nine Muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship." That's some sharp , critical satire , and it's not appropriate for a wedding .
Short but still tedious ?
That's like hot ice and strange snow .
How can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
It's a play about ten words long , which is the shortest play I've ever heard of .
In the entire play , not one word is well-written , and not one of the actors is right for his part .
It's tragic because Pyramus kills himself .
I have to admit that when I saw his suicide during rehearsal , I had tears in my eyes , but they were tears of laughter .
Who are the actors ?
So let's see it .
No , my noble lord .
This play isn't right for you .
I've seen the whole thing , and it's completely worthless , unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines , which they memorized so painfully , are funny .
I'll watch this play .
Come on , bring them in .
You won't see anything like that , sweetheart .
He just said that they're no good at acting .
In my travels , great scholars have come up to me , meaning to greet me with well-rehearsed welcoming speeches , and I have seen them tremble and turn pale , and pause inappropriately in the middle of their sentences , and botch their well-rehearsed tones of voice because they're so nervous , and then break off abruptly at the end , without actually welcoming me .
Therefore , love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they're saying the least , in my opinion .
Your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
Let him come forward .
If we happen to offend you , it's because we want to .
We don't want you to think we came here to offend you , except that we want to offend you with our good intentions .
Please keep in mind we're only here out of spite .
We don't come here with the intention of making you happy .
We're absolutely not here to delight you .
By watching their show , you'll find out everything you're likely to know .
This guy doesn't pay much attention to punctuation .
He rode that prologue like a wild horse .
He didn't know how to stop it .
The moral of this story is that it's not enough to speak ; you have to speak grammatically .
His speech was like a tangled chain .
Who's next ?
I wonder if the lion's going to talk .
It wouldn't surprise me , my lord .
Can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
It's the smartest partition I've ever heard speak , my lord .
Pyramus is coming up to the wall .
Be quiet !
I'm afraid my Thisbe has forgotten her promise ! , And you , oh Wall , oh sweet , oh lovely Wall , you stand between her father's property and mine , you Wall , oh Wall , oh sweet and lovely Wall .
God bless you for doing this .
But what's this I see ?
I don't see any Thisbe .
Oh wicked wall , through which I don't see any happiness !
Damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
Since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
I see a voice !
I'll go to the hole to see if I can hear my Thisbe's face .
Thisbe ?
You are my love , my love , I think .
I'm your love , no matter what you think .
Will you meet me right away at Ninny's grave ?
Neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
I , Wall , have done my part .
Now that I'm done , Wall can go away .
This is the silliest thing I've ever seen .
The best plays are still only illusions , and the worst are just as good , if you just use your imagination to fill them in .
In that case it's your imagination that's interesting , not the play .
Look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
Ah , it's a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
He's as brave as a fox .
True .
And as wise as a goose .
Oh , that's not true , my lord .
He's not brave enough to be wise .
He's not wise enough to be brave .
Anyway , he is what he is .
Let's listen to the moon .
This lantern represents the moon .
I myself am playing the man in the moon , Well then , that's the biggest mistake of all .
The man should be inside the lantern .
How else is he the "man in the moon" ?
He can't go in there because of the candle .
It's too hot .
I'm tired of this moon .
Go ahead , Moon .
All I wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon , I'm the man in the moon , this thornbush is my thornbush , and this dog is my dog .
Well , all of these should be in the lantern , because they're all in the moon .
But be quiet , here comes Thisbe .
This is old Ninny's tomb .
But where is my love ?
Good roaring , Lion !
Good running , Thisbe !
Good shining , Moon ! , Really , the Moon shines very well .
That's good , Lion !
Oh , teach me how you look the way you do , and which tricks you used to make Demetrius fall in love with you .
I frown at him , but he still loves me .
Oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
I curse him , but he loves me .
If only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
The more I hate him , the more he follows me around .
The more I love him , the more he hates me .
It's not my fault he acts like that , Helena .
That's true , it's your beauty's fault .
I wish I had a fault like that !
Don't worry .
He won't see my face ever again .
Lysander and I are running away from here .
Before I saw Lysander , Athens seemed like paradise to me .
But Lysander's so attractive that he's turned heaven into hell !
Helena , we'll tell you about our secret plan .
Tomorrow night , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers ) , we plan to sneak out of Athens .
And then Pyramus showed up .
So the lion disappeared .
Sweet Moon , I thank you for your sunny beams .
But , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
Eyes , do you see ?
How can it be ?
Oh , dainty duck !
Oh , dear !
Oh , Fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
Conquer , crush , conclude , and kill !
Oh , Mother Nature , why did you create lions ?
And so I'm dying .
Okay , now I'm dead .
Now die , die , die , die , die .
With a doctor's help he might recover and become an ass again .
I don't think a ridiculous Pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
I hope she keeps it short .
Look , she's spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
And now she'll start moaning , of course , Are you asleep , my love ?
What , are you dead , my dove ?
Oh , Pyramus , get up !
Speak , speak .
Can't you talk ?
Dead , dead ?
The dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
Your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
Lovers , moan and weep .
His eyes were as green as leeks .
Oh , Fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
Soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
Tongue , do not speak .
Come , trusty sword .
Come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead .
Yes , and Wall too .
No epilogue , please .
Never apologize , when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
As a matter of fact , if the playwright had played Pyramus and hanged himself with Thisbe's belt , it would have been a very good tragedy .
It's a good tragedy , very well done .
But come on , let's see you do your dance .
Forget your epilogue .
The clock has chimed midnight .
Lovers , it's time to go to bed .
It's almost fairy time .
Dear friends , let's go to bed .
Let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
First rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
We'll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
If you forgive us , we'll make everything all right .
I'm an honest Puck , and I swear that if we're lucky enough not to get hissed at , we'll make it up to you soon .
If not , then I'm a liar .
So good night to everyone .
Give me some applause , if we're friends , and Robin will make everything up to you .
From then on we'll turn our backs on Athens .
We'll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
Goodbye , old friend .
We need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
I will , my Hermia .
Goodbye , Helena .
I hope Demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
But so what ?
Demetrius doesn't think so , and that's all that matters .
He refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
Love can make worthless things beautiful .
When we're in love , we don't see with our eyes but with our minds .
That's why paintings of Cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
And love doesn't have good judgment either , Cupid , has wings and no eyes , so he's bound to be reckless and hasty .
That's why they say love is a child .
He'll run after her .
Is everyone here ?
First , Peter Quince , tell us what the play is about , then read the names of the actors , and then shut up .
Answer when I call your name. , Nick Bottom , the weaver ?
Here .
Tell me which part I'm going to play , then go on .
You , Nick Bottom , have been cast as Pyramus .
What's Pyramus ?
I'll moan very believably. , Name the other actors. , But I'm really in the mood to play a tyrant .
I could do a great job with Hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
A lover would have to be weepier , of course .
Francis Flute , the bellows-repairman ?
Here , Peter Quince .
Who's Thisbe ?
A knight on a quest ?
Thisbe is the lady Pyramus is in love with .
No , come on , don't make me play a woman .
I'm growing a beard .
That doesn't matter .
You'll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
In that case , if I can wear a mask , let me play Thisbe too !
Bottom , you're Pyramus. , And Flute , you're Thisbe .
Robin Starveling , the tailor ?
Here , Peter Quince .
Robin Starveling , you're going to play Thisbe's mother. , Tom Snout , the handyman .
Here , Peter Quince .
I hope this play is well cast now .
Do you have the lion's part written down ?
If you do , please give it to me , because I need to start learning the lines .
Let me play the lion too .
And that would get us all executed .
Yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
Well , my friends , you've got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies , they'd have no choice but to execute us .
Because Pyramus is a good-looking man , the most handsome man that you could find on a summer's day , a lovely gentlemanly man .
So you're the only one who could play Pyramus .
Well then , I'll do it .
What kind of beard should I wear for the part ?
Whatever kind you want , I guess .
No , you'll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
And since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
Finally the new moon , curved like a silver bow in the sky , will look down on our wedding celebration .
Sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
We don't want it at our festivities .
But I'll marry you under different circumstances , with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
Long live Theseus , our famous and respected duke !
I'll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard , or a sandy beard , or a red beard , or one of those bright yellow beards that's the color of a French coin .
It's best to rehearse there , because if we do it here in the city , we'll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play .
Meanwhile , I'll make a list of props that we'll need for the play .
Don't leave me in the lurch .
We'll be there , and there we'll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
Goodbye .
We'll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke's forest .
Got it ?
Be there , or don't show your face again .
Hello , spirit !
Where are you going ?
I go over hills and valleys , through bushes and thorns , over parks and fenced-in spaces , through water and fire .
I wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the Earth .
I work for Titania , the Fairy Queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
The cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
Their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
Now I have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
Goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
I've got to go .
The queen and her elves will be here soon .
He's furious because she stole an adorable boy from an Indian king .
He wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
Instead , she puts flowers in the boy's hair and makes a fuss over him .
You do their work for them and give them good luck .
That's you , right ?
What you say is true .
That's me you're talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
When she takes a sip , I bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck .
But I slip from underneath her and she falls down , crying , "Ow , my butt ! " and starts coughing , and then everyone laughs and has fun .
But step aside , fairy !
Here comes Oberon .
And here's my mistress , Titania .
I wish he'd go away !
How What , are you jealous , Oberon ? , Fairies , let's get out of here .
I've sworn I'll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
Wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
The only reason you left India was to come here and see that butch Amazon Hippolyta .
She was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover , and now that she's getting married to Theseus , you've come to celebrate their marriage .
How can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and Hippolyta , when you know that I know about your love for Theseus ?
Weren't you the one who made him desert Perigouna in the middle of the night , right after he'd raped her ?
And weren't you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends , like Aegles , Ariadne , and Antiopa ?
These are nothing but jealous lies .
We haven't been able to meet on a hill or in a valley , in the forest or a meadow , by a pebbly fountain or a rushing stream , or on the beach by the ocean without you disturbing us .
And because you interrupt us so that we can't dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
So all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
Sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
So the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
Spring , summer , fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places , and now the confused world doesn't know which is which .
And this is all because of our argument .
We are responsible for this .
Do something about it , then .
You have the power to fix it .
Why would Titania want to argue with her Oberon ?
All I'm asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
Get over it .
I won't give up this child for all of Fairyland .
How long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
Maybe until after Theseus's wedding day .
If you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations , then you can come with us .
If not , leave me alone , and I'll stay away from your turf .
Give me that boy and I'll come with you .
Not for your entire fairy kingdom. , Come , fairies , let's go .
We're going to have an out-and-out brawl if I stay any longer .
Well , go on your way , then .
You won't leave this grove until I've paid you back for this insult .
Yes , I remember .
You couldn't see him , but I could .
He took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
But I could see that Cupid's fiery arrow was put out by watery , virginal moonbeams , so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love .
But I paid attention to where Cupid's arrow fell .
It fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
Young girls call it "love-in-idleness." Bring me that flower .
I showed it to you once .
If its juice is put on someone's eyelids while they're asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
Bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
I could go around the world in forty minutes .
When I have the juice of that flower , I'll trickle some drops of it on Titania's eyes while she's sleeping .
She'll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up , even if it's a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
And before I make her normal again , I can cure her by treating her with another plant , I'll make her give me that little boy as my page .
But who's that coming this way ?
Look , I don't love you , so stop following me around .
Where are Lysander and beautiful Hermia ?
Lysander I want to stop , but Hermia stops my heart from beating .
You told me they escaped into this forest .
And here I am , going crazy in the middle of the woods because I can't find my Hermia .
Go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
You attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
But you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
If you let go of your power to attract me , I won't have any power to follow you .
Do I ask you to follow me ?
Do I speak to you kindly ?
Don't I tell you in the clearest terms that I do not and can not love you ?
Yes , but that makes me love you even more .
I'm your little dog , Demetrius .
The more you beat me , the more I'll love you .
Treat me like you would treat a dog , kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
Just let me follow behind you , even though I'm not good enough for you .
Just looking at you makes me sick .
And I get sick when I can't look at you .
I rely on your virtue to protect me .
This forest doesn't seem deserted when you're here , because you are all the world to me .
So how can anyone say I'm alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
I'll run away from you and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals .
The wildest animal isn't as cruel as you are .
Leave me alone .
Or if you follow me , you'd better understand that I'll do something bad to you in the forest .
Yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
Shame on you , Demetrius !
Your behavior is an insult to all women .
We can not fight for love as men can .
I'll follow you and turn this hell I'm in into a kind of heaven .
Goodbye , nymph .
Before he leaves this part of the forest , you'll change places : you'll be the one running away , and he'll be in love with you .
Do you have the flower ?
Welcome , traveler .
Yes , here it is .
Please , give it to me .
Thanks , good Egeus .
What's new with you ?
I'm here , full of anger , to complain about my daughter Hermia. , Step forward , Demetrius. , My lord , this man , Demetrius , has my permission to marry her. , Step forward , Lysander. , But this other man , Lysander , has cast a magic spell over my child's heart. , You , you , Lysander , you've given her poems , and exchanged tokens of love with my daughter .
You've pretended to be in love with her , singing fake love songs softly at her window by moonlight , and you've captured her imagination by giving her locks of your hair , rings , toys , trinkets , knickknacks , little presents , flowers , and candies , things that can really influence an impressionable young person .
You've connived to steal my daughter's heart , making her stubborn and harsh instead of obedient ( like she should be ) . , And , my gracious duke , if she won't agree to marry Demetrius right now , I ask you to let me exercise the right that all fathers have in Athens .
Since she belongs to me , I can do what I want with her , as the law says : I can either make her marry Demetrius , or have her killed .
What do you have to say for yourself , Hermia ?
Demetrius is an admirable man .
Titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
Snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
I'll put the juice of this flower on Titania's eyes , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires .
Don't worry , sir .
I'm at your service .
Okay , let's go !
Everything's fine now .
One of us will stay and stand guard .
Whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
Wake up when something nasty is nearby .
Let's do that , Lysander .
I'm going to rest my head on this little slope .
We'll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
No , Lysander .
Don't sleep so close to me .
I just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
So let me sleep next to you .
Stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
I hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
Amen to that .
I'll sleep over here .
Stop , Demetrius !
Stop , even if only to kill me .
I'm telling you , get out of here , and don't follow me around like this .
Oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
Don't .
Stay here at your own risk .
I'm going on alone .
Oh , I'm out of breath from this foolish chase .
The more I pray , the less I get out of it .
Hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
How did her eyes get so bright ?
Not from crying .
If that's the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
No , no , I'm as ugly as a bear , since animals that see me run away in terror .
So it's no surprise that Demetrius runs away from me as if I were a monster .
What evil and deceitful mirror made me think I could rival Hermia's starry eyes ?
Don't say that , Lysander .
Don't say that .
Why do you care that he loves Hermia ?
What does it matter ?
Happy with Hermia ?
No .
I regret all the boring time I wasted with her .
I don't love Hermia ; I love Helena .
Fruits and vegetables don't ripen until the right season of the year .
Likewise , I'm young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
Is it not enough , is it not enough , young man , that I'll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from Demetrius ?
Do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
But goodbye .
I have to tell you , I thought you were a much kinder person than this .
Oh , how awful that a lady who's been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one !
Are we all here ?
Right on time .
This is the perfect place to rehearse .
This clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
Peter Quince , What is it , jolly Bottom ?
There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and Thisbe that will never work .
First of all , Pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself , which the ladies in the audience won't be able to stand .
What should we do about that ?
I think we'll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
Not at all !
I've got a plan that will fix everything .
I'll tell them that we won't hurt anyone with our swords , and that Pyramus isn't really dead .
And to make it even clearer , we can tell them that I'm playing Pyramus but I'm not really Pyramus , really , I'm Bottom the weaver .
That'll keep them from being afraid .
All right , we'll have a prologue then .
We'll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
No , add a couple more syllables .
Make it eight and eight .
Won't the ladies be scared of the lion ?
I'm really worried about that .
There's no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
So we need another prologue to tell everyone he's not a real lion .
No , we can just announce the actor's name , and let his face show through the lion costume , and have him say something himself .
Because , you know , Pyramus and Thisbe meet by moonlight .
So is Lysander .
You're right , Lysander's admirable too .
But since your father doesn't want him to marry you , you have to consider Demetrius to be the better man .
I wish my father could see them with my eyes .
No , you must see them as your father sees them .
Your grace , please forgive me .
But please , tell me the worst thing that could happen to me if I refuse to marry Demetrius .
So think carefully about what you want , beautiful Hermia .
Consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
Will the moon be shining on the night we're performing our play ?
We need a calendar !
Look in the almanac .
Look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
What do you think , Bottom ?
He can hold his fingers in a V-shape like this , and Pyramus and Thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack .
If we can do that , everything will be all right .
Now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts , Pyramus , you start .
When you have said your lines , go hide in that bush. , Everyone else , go there too when you're not onstage .
Speak , Pyramus. , Thisbe , come forward .
Yes , you are .
You're supposed to show that you understand that Pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back .
That's "Ninus's grave , " man .
And don't say all of that yet .
You just said all your lines at once , cues and all. , Pyramus , enter .
It's "never get tired." Oh !
Help !
It's a monster !
We're being haunted .
Run , everyone , run !
I'll follow you .
Sometimes I'll turn into fire !
And I'll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
Why are they running away ?
Oh , Bottom , you've changed !
What have you got on your head ?
What do you think I've got on my head ?
You're acting like an ass , don't you think ?
God bless you , Bottom , God bless you .
Reborn .
But I won't leave this spot , no matter what they do .
I'll walk up and down and sing a song , so they'll know I'm not afraid .
Who'd waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
I don't think you've got much of a reason to love me .
But to tell you the truth , reason and love have very little to do with each other these days .
It's too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn't introduce them .
You're as wise as you are beautiful .
No , that's not true .
But if I were smart enough to get out of this forest , I'd be wise enough to satisfy myself .
I'm no ordinary fairy .
So come with me .
And I'll turn you into a spirit like us , so you won't die as humans do. , Come here , Peaseblossom , Cobweb , Moth , and Mustardseed !
Ready .
Me too .
Me too .
And me too .
Where should we go ?
Be kind and polite to this gentleman .
Leap and dance for him .
Feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
Pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
Bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
Hello , mortal !
Hello !
Hello !
Hello !
I beg your pardon , sirs. , Please tell me your name , sir ?
Cobweb .
I'd like to get to know you better , Mr. Cobweb .
If I cut my finger , I'll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding. , And your name , sir ?
Peaseblossom .
Please , give my regards to your mother , Mrs. Peapod , and your father , Mr. Peapod .
Good Mr. Peaseblossom , I'd like to get to know you better too. , And you , may I ask what your name is , sir ?
Mustardseed .
Good Mr. Mustardseed , I know you very well .
Those cowardly , gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef .
I swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
I look forward to getting to know you better , Mr. Mustardseed .
Take good care of him .
Take him to my sleeping area .
The moon looks sad to me .
When she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
Keep my lover quiet .
Bring him to me in silence .
Ah , here comes my messenger. , What's going on , you crazy spirit ?
What havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
My mistress Titania is in love with a monster .
I led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
At that exact moment , Titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
This is going even better than I planned .
But have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that Athenian , as I asked you to do ?
Yes , I found him when he was asleep , so that's taken care of too , and the Athenian woman was sleeping near him .
Why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
Save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
If you killed Lysander while he was sleeping , then you're already up to your ankles in blood .
He was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
Would he have snuck away from me while I was asleep ?
The only possibility is that you've murdered him .
A murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
That's how someone who's been murdered should look , and that's how I look .
You've pierced me through the heart with your cruelty , and yet you , the murderer , look as bright and clear as a star in the sky .
What does that have to do with my Lysander ?
Where is he ?
Oh , good Demetrius , will you find him for me ?
Did you kill him , then ?
Oh , how brave of you !
A snake could do that as easily as you could .
A snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
I didn't kill Lysander .
As far as I know , he's not even dead .
Then please tell me he's all right .
If I told you that , what would I get out of it ?
Please give in , sweet Hermia. , And Lysander , stop acting like she's yours .
Her father loves you , Demetrius .
She's mine , and I'm giving her to Demetrius .
The privilege of never seeing me again .
And now I'm going to leave your despised company .
You'll never see me again , whether or not he's dead .
So I'll stay here for a while .
That's the way of the world .
Go around the forest , moving faster than the wind , and make sure you find Helena of Athens. , She's lovesick , and her face is pale from all the sighing she's been doing , because sighing is bad for the blood .
You purple flower , hit by Cupid's arrow , sink into the pupils of this man's eyes .
Young man , when you wake up , if she's nearby , beg her to cure your lovesickness .
Should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
Lord , what fools these mortals are !
Step aside .
The noise they're making will wake up Demetrius .
Then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
Why do you think I'm making fun of you when I tell you I love you ?
People don't cry when they're mocking someone .
How can it seem like I'm making fun of you , when my tears prove that I'm sincere ?
You get trickier and trickier .
Will you abandon her ?
Demetrius loves her , and he doesn't love you .
Damn it !
I see you're all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
You're competing for
Don't be cruel , Demetrius .
In exchange , give up your claim to love Helena , since I love her and will love her until I die .
Lysander , keep your Hermia .
I don't want her .
Helena , it's not true .
Look , here comes the woman you love .
It's hard to see clearly in the dark of night , but it's easier to hear well .
I couldn't see you , Lysander , but I heard your voice , and that's how I found you .
Why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
Why stay when love tells you to go ?
But what love could make my Lysander leave me ?
I had to hurry to my love , beautiful Helena , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars .
Why are you looking for me ?
Didn't you figure out that I left you because I hate you ?
You can't mean what you're saying .
It's impossible .
So , she's in on this too !
Now I see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
Have you forgotten all the talks we've had together , the vows we made to be like sisters to one another , all the hours we spent together , wishing that we never had to say goodbye , have you forgotten ?
Our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
We used to sit together and sew one flower with our two needles , sewing it on one piece of cloth , sitting on the same cushion , singing one song in the same key , as if our hands , our sides , our voices and our minds were stuck together .
We grew together like twin cherries , which seemed to be separate but were also together , two lovely cherries on one stem .
There is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
She can't even imagine what "love" is .
It would be bad if she knew about Benedick's love and teased him about it .
It's true .
And so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
But who would dare tell her ?
If I said something , she'd mock me so mercilessly that I'd probably disintegrate into air .
She'd laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
Like a fire that gets covered up , Benedick should smother his love and waste away .
It would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked , which is as bad as being killed by tickling .
No , instead I'll go to Benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
You don't know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
Oh , don't injure your cousin like that !
With the quick , intelligent wit she's rumored to have , she can't really be such a bad judge of character that she'd refuse a man as exceptional as Signior Benedick .
He's the only worthy man in Italy , aside from my dear Claudio .
True , he has an excellent reputation .
And he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
When are you getting married , madam ?
Tomorrow , and then every day after that .
Come on , let's go inside .
I'll stay in Messina until you're married , and then I'll go to Aragon .
I'll go with you , my lord , if you'll allow me .
No , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it .
I'll ask only Benedick to come with me , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he's a joker .
He's evaded love once or twice , and since then Cupid doesn't dare to shoot at him .
Benedick's heart is like a bell , with his tongue as the clapper : everything his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
Gentleman , I am not the same man I was before .
I agree .
I hope he's in love .
There isn't a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
If he looks serious , he must need money .
What , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
I repeat , he's in love .
Unless you're talking about his love for this kind of foolishness , which , judging from his appearance , he has , he is no fool for love , as you pretend .
If he's not in love with a woman , then you can't trust the usual symptoms .
He brushes his hat in the mornings .
What do you think that means ?
Has any man seen him at the barber's ?
No , but the barber's assistant has been seen with him .
And he's rubbed himself with perfume .
Can you smell out his secret now ?
But when You take up your duties too cheerfully .
That's what her mother always tells me .
Ah , he got you back , Benedick !
Congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
Well , even if he is her father , I'm sure she wouldn't want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
I'm amazed you're still talking , Signior Benedick .
No one's listening to you .
Look , it's my dear Lady Disdain !
Aren't you dead yet ?
That's as good as proof that the sweet young man's in love .
The biggest clue is his seriousness .
And when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
Yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
I hear what they say about him for doing that .
Indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a Truly , it all adds up to a serious story for Benedick .
A conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
Oh , and I know who loves him .
She'll be buried with her face upwards , then .
This chatter is no cure for my toothache .
It must be .
My lord and brother , God save you .
Good evening , brother .
If you don't mind , I'd like to speak with you .
In private ?
If you wish .
But Count Claudio can stay , for what I'm about to say concerns him .
What's the matter ?
You know that he does .
I don't know that , once he knows what I know .
If there's any reason we shouldn't get married , I urge you to tell me .
You may think that I don't love you .
I hope that , after I tell you my news , you will think better of me .
My brother thinks highly of you , and because of his affection , has helped arrange your marriage , but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .
Why , what's the matter ?
I came here to tell you , I'll make this short , since she's already been talked about for too long , the lady is unfaithful .
Who , Hero ?
That's the one : Leonato's Hero , your Hero , every man's Hero .
Unfaithful ?
The word is too good to represent her wickedness .
She is worse than wicked .
If you can think of a more awful title , I'll call her that .
But don't keep wondering without more proof .
Come with me tonight , and you'll see a man enter her bedroom chamber , even tonight , the night before her wedding .
If you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
But you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
I won't consider it .
If I see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , I'll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where I would have married her .
And since I wooed her in your name , I'll join you in disgracing her .
Remain calm until midnight , and then you'll see what the trouble is .
Oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
Oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
Oh , a plague has been prevented , thank God !
That's what you'll say once you've seen part two .
Are you all good and honest men ?
Come here , Sir Seacole .
God has blessed you with a good name .
To be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
Both of which , master constable , You have .
I knew that would be your answer .
Well , for your good looks , sir , thank God and don't boast about it .
You're thought to be the most
you will And what if he won't stop ?
Then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank God that you've gotten rid of such a criminal .
If he won't stop when he's told to , then he isn't one of the Prince's subjects .
We know what's appropriate for a watch .
Why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
Also , you're supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who's drunk to go home and go to bed .
And what if they won't go ?
Well then , leave them alone until they're sober .
If even then they don't answer to your satisfaction , you can say that they're not the men you thought they were .
Very good , sir .
So if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
You , constable , are representing the Prince himself .
If you meet the Prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
No , by our Lady , I don't think he can .
I'll bet any man who knows the law five shillings to one on it .
By our Lady , I think that's true .
And if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
Well gentlemen , we've heard our assignment .
Let's sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
One more thing , good gentlemen .
Watch over Signior Leonato's house ; with the wedding being held there tomorrow , there's a great to-do there tonight .
Adieu .
Be Conrade !
Conrade , I say !
Come to think of it , I thought I felt a scab there .
I'll get you for that .
Now get on with your story .
Since it's drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , I'll tell you everything .
You should know I've earned a thousand gold pieces from Don John .
Is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
You should ask instead if it's possible that any criminal could be so rich .
Because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
I can't believe it .
That only proves how inexperienced you are .
You know that the style of a man's jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
Yes , it's just clothing .
Yes , fashion is fashion .
C'mon , I might as well say the fool's the fool !
But don't you see what a Did you hear someone ?
Just the weathervane moving .
But you're all wound up about fashion , too .
No , I'm not wound up .
But I will tell you that I seduced Margaret , the Lady Hero's waiting woman , tonight .
I should backtrack and begin with how my master , Don John , arranged for the Prince , Claudio , and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard .
That makes Lady Courtesy a traitor .
All ladies love me , except you .
It's too bad I'm so hard-hearted , because I really don't love anyone .
Women are lucky , then .
You would make a nasty suitor .
I would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me .
Well , I hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up .
If he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn't make him look any worse .
Listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
I'd rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
I wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
That's it , I'm done .
You always slip out of the argument like this .
I know you from before .
And that's everything , Leonato. , Claudio , Benedick , my dear friend Leonato has invited you all to stay here at Messina .
I told him we'll stay for at least a month , and he says that he hopes we'll stay longer .
I think he's actually serious , and not just being polite .
And they thought Margaret was Hero ?
We charge you , in the Prince's name , to stop !
Call up the Master Constable Dogberry .
We have And one of them is the criminal Deformed .
I know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
Gentlemen , gentlemen , Gentlemen , don't speak .
We
We're probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
Let's go , we'll obey you .
Good Ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
I will , lady .
And request that she come here .
Very well .
Really , I think your other ruff is better .
No , please good Meg , I'll wear this one .
Honestly , it's not as good as the other one , and I'm sure your cousin will agree with me .
My cousin's a fool , and you are too .
I'll wear this one and none other .
I like your new wig and headdress , though I'd like it more if the hair were a shade browner .
You know , I saw the Duchess of Milan's gown , the one that everyone praises so highly .
Oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
But for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
I hope I enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
It will be made even heavier soon , by the weight of a man .
Shame of what , lady ?
Sex and marriage are honorable things , even for a beggar , right ?
And isn't your husband an honorable man ?
Good morning , sweet Hero .
Why do you sound so odd ?
Are you ill ?
You sound out of tune .
You sing , and I'll dance .
Never !
The Count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
Sorry , I'm all stuffed .
Ever since you lost yours .
Doesn't my wit suit me well ?
It doesn't get seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap , the way fools wear coxcombs .
God , I'm really sick .
I just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
Maybe you think that I think you're in love .
No , by Our Lady , I'm not such a fool to think what I please , and I don't please to think what I can , and in fact I can not think , even if I could think my heart right past thinking , that you are in love or that you will be in love or even that you can be in love .
But Benedick was once an enemy of love as well , and now he's become a real man .
He swore that he'd never get married , but now , despite his earlier protestations , he loves ungrudgingly .
And yet I think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
It's not a false gallop , anyway .
Madam , we have to go : the Prince , the Count , Signior Benedick , Don John , and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church .
Good cousin , good Meg , good Ursula , come help me get dressed .
What do you want from me , my good man ?
Indeed , sir , it is .
Yes , it truly is .
What's the news , my good friends ?
Sorry , sir , Goodman Verges tends to ramble .
Thank you for saying that , your Worship , but we're just the poor duke's officers .
But truly , if I were as
Oh , so you'd give me all your tediousness ?
Yes , even if I had a thousand more pounds than that , for I hear that you are Me , too .
God gives those gifts , I had nothing to do with it .
Now I must return to the wedding .
One more thing , sir .
Examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
Now I'm in a great hurry , as I'm sure you can see .
Goodbye .
My lord , they're waiting for you to give your daughter away to Claudio .
I'm coming .
Go to Francis Seacole , the constable of the watch .
Tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
We won't hold back any of our wisdom .
We'll drive them to a
I am being serious , my lord .
Thank you .
I'm not a man who talks a lot , but I thank you .
If it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
Give me your hand , Leonato .
We will go in together .
Benedick , did you notice Signior Leonato's daughter ?
I saw her , but I didn't notice her .
Isn't she a well-mannered young lady ?
Do you want my true opinion ?
Or do you want me to criticize her like I do all women ?
No , please , speak seriously .
Well , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly , too dark to be praised fairly , and too small to be praised greatly .
I can only say this about her : if she looked different than she does , she would be ugly , and since she can't be anything but herself , I don't like her .
You think I'm kidding .
Please tell me seriously what you think of her .
All right , Friar Francis , let's keep this short .
No .
No , he comes to be married Lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
I do .
If either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , I order you on your souls to say so .
Do you know any , Hero ?
None , my lord .
Do you know any , count ?
I'm sure I can answer for him , he doesn't know any , either .
Oh , the things men dare to do !
The things men are allowed to do !
The things men do daily , not knowing what they're doing !
What , are we playing with interjections ?
Well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like Hold on , Friar .
As freely , son , as God gave her to me .
And what should I give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
Nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
There , Leonato , take your daughter back .
She only appears honorable from the outside .
Look , how she blushes like a virgin !
Oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
Doesn't that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
All of you who are looking at her , wouldn't you swear that she's a virgin , judging by these outward shows ?
But she is no virgin .
She has been in a man's bed .
She blushes from guilt , not modesty .
What do you mean , my lord ?
My dear lord , if it was you who conquered her and took her virginity , I know what you're about to say .
And have I ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
Curse you for your false appearances !
Is that why you're talking so wildly ?
Good Prince , say something !
What should I say ?
I've been dishonored : I arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
Are you really saying these things , or am I dreaming ?
They're really being spoken , sir , and they're true .
This doesn't look like a wedding .
It's true !
Oh God !
Leonato , am I standing here ?
Is this the Prince ?
Is this the Prince's brother ?
Is this face Hero's ?
Are these our eyes ?
Yes , that's all true , but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
Let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
As my child , I order you to do so .
Oh , God help me !
What kind of game is this ?
We just want you to answer to your real name .
Isn't my name Hero ?
Who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
Indeed , Hero herself can !
You've stained your virtue with your own actions .
What man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
If you're a virgin , you'll answer this question .
I wasn't talking to any man at that time , my lord .
I swear on my honor that we saw and heard Hero talking to a brute at her window last night .
Pretty lady , I'm much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
What's wrong , cousin ?
Why have you collapsed ?
Come , let's go .
These revelations have overwhelmed her .
How is she ?
She's dead , I think. , Help , uncle ! , Hero , why Hero !
Uncle !
Signior Benedick !
Friar !
Death is the best way to cover over her shame .
How are you , Hero ?
Yes , why shouldn't she ?
Why not !
Isn't every living thing condemning her ?
Am I sorry that I only had one child ?
Do I blame Nature for being so thrifty ?
Oh , one child is one too many !
Why did I ever have one ?
Why did you once seem lovely to me ?
Why didn't I just adopt a beggar's child left at my doorstep , whose shame and dishonor I could have denied , not being its true father ?
Sir , sir , calm down .
I'm so amazed by this , I don't know what to say .
Oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
Lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
No , I didn't , but I did every night for the past year .
Then it's confirmed !
And in her eyes I see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity .
But she must be , Friar .
You see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges : she doesn't want to add perjury to her list of sins .
The princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
Two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame John the Bastard , who lives to create conflict .
I don't know .
If they have spoken the truth about Hero , I will tear her apart with my bare hands .
Age hasn't dried up my body or eroded my intelligence so much , and luck hasn't robbed me of so much of my fortune , and my bad ways haven't deprived me of so many friends , that they won't find me ready to seek revenge both physically and mentally , with money and friends at my disposal .
Hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
The princes left your daughter here for dead .
Hide her for a while in your house , and tell everyone that she has , in fact , died .
Make a bug show of mourning for her , hang sad epitaphs up at your family's tomb , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies .
Why should we do this ?
What will this do ?
That will be a good thing .
We'll maintain that she died the instant she was accused , and everyone who hears this will grieve for her , pity her , and excuse her actions .
That's how Claudio will respond .
And even if they don't , at least Hero's supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity .
And if it doesn't go well , then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery , the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation , away from the public's eyes , tongues , mind , and insults .
Signior Leonato , listen to the friar's plan .
And even though you know I'm very close to the Prince and Claudio , I swear I'll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly .
Are you thinking of buying her ?
But tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
Or are you just teasing ?
If I'm going to sing along with you , I need to know what key you're singing in .
I think she's the most wonderful woman I've ever laid eyes on .
I'm still young enough to see without glasses , and I don't see what you're talking about .
But , hey , this doesn't mean you're looking to get married , does it ?
Even if I had sworn never to marry , I wouldn't trust myself to keep that promise if Hero would marry me .
What's going on these days ?
Isn't there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
Look , Don Pedro has come back for you .
This is a good agreement .
Come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
Hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
Have patience and endure .
Lady Beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
Yes , and I'll keep crying a while longer .
I don't wish that on you .
I really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
Oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
Is there any way I could show such friendship to you ?
A very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
Can a man do it ?
It's a job meant for a man , but not you .
There is nothing in the world that I love as much as you .
Isn't that strange ?
It's as strange as this other thing which I don't understand .
I feel awful for my cousin .
By my sword , Beatrice , you love me .
Not with any sauce they could provide for them .
I swear , I love you .
Well then , God forgive me !
Why , what have you done , sweet Beatrice ?
You got to me first .
I was about to swear that I loved you .
Then do so , with all your heart .
I love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
Come , ask me to do anything for you .
Kill Claudio .
Ha !
I wouldn't do that for the whole wide world .
Then , rejecting my request , you kill
Wait , sweet Beatrice .
My body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
You don't really love me .
I beg you to let me go .
Beatrice , I swear , I'm going .
Not until we part as friends .
How dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
Is Claudio your enemy ?
Hasn't he proven himself to be a great villain , slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
Oh , I wish I were a man !
He pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows , and then , with public accusation , blatant slander , pure hatred , Oh God , if only I were a man !
I would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
Listen to me , Beatrice , Talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
A likely story !
No , but Beatrice , Sweet Hero , she's been wronged , she's been slandered , she's been ruined .
Beat ,
Princes and counts !
He's a proper count , that Count Sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
Oh , if only I were a man !
Or had a friend who would be a man for me !
All this conversing has turned men into tongues , and fancy ones , at that .
The man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as Hercules .
I can't make myself a man by wishing I were , so as a woman I'll die , from grieving .
Wait , good Beatrice .
I swear by this hand that I love you .
Don't just swear by it ; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me .
That's enough for me , then .
I'll challenge him .
I'll kiss your hand , and with that I leave you .
I swear that Claudio will pay dearly for this .
Keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
Which ones are the malefactors ?
Sir , that would be me and my partner .
Have them come in front of the master constable .
Yes , indeed , bring them before me .
What's your name , friend ?
Borachio .
Please , write down "Borachio." , And yours ?
I'm a gentleman , sir , and my name is Conrade .
Write down "Master Gentleman Conrade." , Gentlemen , are you good Christians , and do you serve God ?
Yes , sir , we hope so .
How do you both plead ?
Honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
He's a marvelously witty fellow , no doubt , but I'll outmaneuver him. , Come over here ; I'll whisper a word in your ear .
Sir , I tell you we believe you're both lying criminals .
Sir , I tell you that we are not .
Well , okay. , I swear to God , both their stories match .
Have you written that down , that they aren't criminals ?
Master Constable , you're going about this all wrong .
First , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
Yes , good idea ; that's the
This man said , sir , that Don John , the Prince's brother , was a villain .
Write down that Prince John is a villain .
I swear , I don't like the look of you .
That Don John had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the Lady Hero .
That's burglary , that is .
Yes , by God , that it is .
What else did you hear ?
What else ?
That's all .
I'll get there first and tell him what we found out .
Honest to God , where's the sexton ?
Come on , tie them up .
Get away from me , you ass !
You ass !
Don't you suspect my office ?
Don't you
If you keep on the way you've been going , you'll kill yourself .
Stop advising me ; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve .
Find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as I loved Hero and ask
So don't advise me .
Please , leave me alone .
I intend to be flesh and blood , not airy philosophy , for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently , even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune .
But don't take all that pain on yourself .
Make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
Now you're talking .
I definitely will .
In my soul , I believe Hero has been falsely accused .
The Prince and Claudio are hurrying this way .
Good evening , good evening .
Good day to both of you .
Listen , my lords , We're in a bit of a hurry , Leonato .
Your highness will have to force me to tell .
It's good if you love Hero , because she's worthy of your love .
You're trying to trick me , my lord .
I swear , I'm telling you what I honestly think .
A bit of a hurry , my lord !
Well then , good bye , my lord .
You're in a hurry , are you ?
Well then , don't bother .
Come on , don't quarrel with us , good old man .
If it's fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
Who has wronged him ?
Indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
Don't bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .
I'm not scared of you .
Curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
Really , I had no intention of going for my sword .
Damn you , don't mock and sneer at me .
I'm not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young , and what he would do now if he weren't so old .
Claudio , I'm telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child .
You have ruined my innocent child .
Your slander has broken her heart , and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb , ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness .
My wickedness ?
Yours , Claudio , yours , I say .
You've got it wrong , old man .
I'll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does , despite his youth and manliness .
Not a chance !
I'll have nothing to do with you .
You think you can get rid of me that easily ?
You killed my child .
Take on someone your own size : if you kill me , boy , you'll have killed a man .
He'll have to kill both of us , and indeed we're both men .
But let him start off easy by killing one of us .
Come on , kill me and brag about it !
Let me at him .
I will , as surely as I am a gentleman .
Brother , Quiet .
God knows I loved my niece , and now she's dead , slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as I would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue .
Brother Anthony ,
Hold your peace .
But brother Anthony , Don't , it's no big deal .
Don't bother with it .
Let me deal with this .
Gentlemen , we won't stay here and anger you further .
I'm sorry about your daughter's death , but I swear our accusations were true , and backed up with proof .
My lord , my lord , I don't want to hear any more about it .
No ?
Come on , brother !
I'm determined to be heard by someone .
And you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
Look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
What's up , mister ?
Welcome , sir .
You just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
We were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
Leonato and his brother .
What do you think ?
I think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
There's no bravery in an unfair fight .
Look : Benedick is so pale , are you sick , or angry ?
Lighten up .
Sir , don't even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
I'll meet all your attacks , even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop .
Choose another tack .
I think he really is angry .
If he is , that's his problem .
Can I have a word with you privately ?
God forbid he wants to challenge me !
lain .
You've killed an innocent woman , and you're going to pay dearly for her death .
What do you say ?
What , are we having a feast ?
Yes , we are .
Benedick , Beatrice praised your wit the other day .
I said you had a fine wit .
True , " she said , "a fine little one." "No , " I said , "a huge wit." "Right , " she said , "a hugely awful one." "No , " I said , "he has a good wit." "Exactly , " she said , "it's good and mild ; it doesn't hurt anyone." "No , " I said , "Benedick is wise." "He is certainly , " she said , She cried a lot at that , and said she didn't care .
That she did .
And yet for all that , if she didn't hate him to death , she'd love him to death .
Leonato's daughter had told us everything .
Absolutely everything .
And , moreover , God saw Benedick when he was hid in the garden .
But when exactly will we see Benedick married ?
Yes , with the sign underneath him that says : "Here lives Benedick the married man" ?
Goodbye , boy .
You know what I intend .
I'll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
The wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword , it can't hurt anyone , thank God. , My lord , I thank you for your many kindnesses .
I'm leaving your court now .
Your brother Don John the Bastard has run away from Messina .
The three of you have killed a sweet , innocent woman .
Lord Babyface over there will meet me in a duel , and good luck to him then .
He's serious .
Very serious , and I'm sure it's because of Beatrice .
And he challenged you to a duel ?
He did , very sincerely .
What a strange sight , a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home !
A guy like that is bigger than an ape , but the ape could be his doctor , it's so much smarter .
But wait a minute .
Let me gather my wits and get serious here .
Didn't he say my brother has run away ?
Come on , you .
If they let you off , then we'll have to assume that Lady Justice has lost all her power .
Since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
What's this ?
Two of my brother's men , all tied up !
Officers , what crime have these men committed ?
Well sir , they've lied ; moreover , they have said things that were not true ; secondarily , they are slanderers ; sixth and lastly , they have falsely accused a lady ; thirdly , they have confirmed things that did not in fact happen ; and , in conclusion , they are lying scoundrels .
First , I ask you what they've done ; thirdly , I ask you what offense they're charged with ; sixth and lastly , I ask you why they've been committed here ; and , in conclusion , I ask what they're accused of .
I tricked your own eyes .
They've recorded my crimes , and I would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
The lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
His words are like poison to me .
Yes , and paid me well for doing it .
He is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
Sweet Hero ; when I imagine you now , you seem as beautiful as you did when I first loved you .
Come , take away the Here comes Master Signior Leonato with the sexton .
Which one of them did it ?
Let me see what he looks like , so when I see another man who resembles him , I'll know to avoid him .
Which one is it ?
If you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
Are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
Yes , I am the one .
No , villain , but you didn't work alone .
I don't know how to ask you for forgiveness , but I have to say something .
Choose your revenge .
I can't ask you to make my daughter live , that's impossible , but I beg you both to tell the people of Messina that she was innocent when she died .
And if your love can produce something from its sadness , write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones .
Sing it tonight .
Then come to my house tomorrow morning , and since you couldn't be my son-in-law , be my nephew instead .
My brother has a daughter who looks exactly like Hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
Marry her as you should have married her cousin , and I will let my revenge die .
And I feel that I love her .
I know that she is worthy of that love .
Or in the power of reason .
I was conceived by a woman , and I thank her very much for all her effort .
And then she brought me up , and I thank her for that , too .
I swear , before I die I'm going to see you sick with love .
With anger , with fever , or with hunger , sure , my friend , but never sick with love .
If you can prove that I'll ever be so in love that I can't be brought to my senses with a good round of beers , you can pluck out my eyes with a love-poet's pen and hang me on a brothel's door where the picture of blind Cupid usually goes .
Oh , noble sir !
Your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
I willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
I will see you tomorrow , then .
Now I have to leave .
This wicked man will be brought face to face with Margaret , who I believe was hired by Don John to take part in this plot .
Thank you for all your efforts .
You speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may God bless you .
God save the charitable organization !
I leave a slimy bastard with you , your Worship , for you to punish and make an example of .
God bless your Worship !
I wish you well .
I hope that God restores you to health .
Goodbye , gentlemen .
We'll see you tomorrow .
We'll be there .
I will mourn Hero tonight .
Please Margaret , help me write this poem for Beatrice .
You certainly deserve it .
It's just that my wit is very gentlemanly , Margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
Now please , tell Beatrice to come out .
I'll go get Beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself , she has legs .
So that means she'll come .
I'm really a pitiful singer .
Take Beatrice , have you come because I called for you ?
Yes , sir , and I'll leave when you ask me to .
Oh , well , stay till then !
I spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that I will kiss you .
If you had foul words in your mouth , then your breath must be foul , and foul breath is nauseating .
Thus , I'll leave without being kissed .
Your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
But I will tell you this very plainly : I have challenged Claudio , and either he'll accept the challenge or admit he's a coward .
Now , tell me , which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
With all of them at once : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .
But tell me , which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
Suffer love !
That's a good way of putting it .
I do suffer love , because I love you against my will .
You love me in spite of your heart , I think .
In this day and age , if a man doesn't erect his own monument before he dies , he won't be remembered past the funeral bell's ringing and his widow's crying .
Exactly how long is that , do you think ?
About an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
That's why it's better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues , like I do .
That's why I praise myself , who , if I do say so myself , is quite praiseworthy .
But tell me , how is your cousin ?
I'm very sick , too .
Have faith , love me , and you will get better .
Madam , you have to go to your uncle's .
It's been proven that Lady Hero is innocent , that the Prince and Claudio have been utterly deceived , and that Don John , who has run away , is the source of all the trouble .
Will you come immediately ?
Will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
I will live in your heart , die in your lap , and be buried in your eyes , and , what's more , I will go with you to your uncle's .
Is this the family tomb of Leonato ?
It is , my lord .
Here lies Hero , The heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
To repay her for her troubles , Death Gives her undying fame .
So the life that died with shame Lives on with fame .
This epitaph will hang here forever , Continuing to praise Hero after I die .
Now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
Now I say good night to your bones , Hero .
I will perform this ceremony every year .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Put out your torches .
The wolves have finished preying for the night , and look , the gentle dawn is rising , dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Didn't I tell you she was innocent ?
And the Prince and Claudio , who accused her , are innocent as well , because they were deceived by Don John .
Well , I'm glad that everything has been sorted out .
Me too , otherwise I would have had to duel with Claudio .
When I send for you , come out wearing masks .
The Prince and Claudio are supposed to be here by now. , You know your job , brother .
You have to pretend to be your niece's father , and give her away to Claudio .
What do you need me to do ?
She sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it's true .
And I see her also through the eyes of love .
And those eyes were endowed with sight by Claudio , the Prince , and me .
But what did you want ?
Sir , I'm puzzled by what you just said .
And I'll help you .
Here comes the Prince and Claudio .
Good morning to all these lovely people .
Good morning , Prince ; good morning , Claudio .
We're waiting here for you .
Are you still set on marrying my brother's daughter ?
I wouldn't change my mind even if she were
Well , time will tell .
Just you wait .
Give him my respects , and tell him I'll definitely be there for dinner , since I know he has gone to great lengths for this meal .
Bring her out , brother .
The friar's ready .
Good morning , Benedick .
I think he's nervous , he's about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
Oh , don't worry about it , we'll dip your I'll get you for that one .
But here are other matters to be dealt with .
Which is the lady I'm supposed to marry ?
This one , and I will give her to you .
No , you can't do that until you take her hand and , in front of this friar , swear to marry her .
It's another Hero !
Exactly right .
And as surely as I am alive , I am a virgin .
It's the former Hero !
The Hero that died !
She was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
I can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
Which one of you is Beatrice ?
Do you love me ?
No , no more than is reasonable .
Well then , your uncle and the Prince and Claudio have been deceived .
They swore you did .
Do you love me ?
Truly , no , no more than is reasonable .
Well then , Margaret , Ursula , and my cousin have been very much deceived , for they swore you did .
They swore that you were sick with love for me .
They swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
Oh , well .
So you don't love me ?
No , I don't , except as a friend .
Come on , niece , I'm sure you love him .
And here's another poem , which I stole from my cousin's pocket , in her handwriting and all about her adoration for Benedick .
What a miracle !
Our handwriting gives away our hearts .
Come on , I'll take you , but honestly I'm only doing it out of pity .
I won't say no to you , but let it be known that I'm only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life , I hear you were quickly wasting away without me .
Oh , shut up !
I'll stop your mouth with a kiss .
How does it feel to be Benedick the Married Man ?
I'll tell you what , Prince : a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn't change my mood today .
You think I care what I'm called ?
Well , I don't .
No , before !
Musicians , play us a song. , Prince , you look sad .
You should get a wife !
Into God's hands .
From my house , if I had a house , " "The sixth of July .
Before you make My lord , you could really help me out now .
I am at your service .
Just tell me what you want me to do , and however hard it is , you'll see that I'm eager to do it .
Does Leonato have a son , my lord ?
Hero is his only child , and his only heir .
Do you like her , Claudio ?
Look , if you really love the beautiful Hero , enjoy it .
Isn't that the reason you told me all this ?
But I didn't want you to think that I'm hasty in my emotions .
That's like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
I'll disguise myself as you and pour out "my" feelings to Hero , taking her prisoner with the force of my love story .
Let's get started right away .
Has he taken care of the music ?
He is taking care of it as we speak .
But brother , I have some strange news for you .
Is it good news ?
Is this servant of yours a smart man ?
He's very bright .
I'll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
He must be very near by now .
When I left him , he was less than nine miles from here .
How many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
Not many , and no one important .
A victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
Claudio deserves to be honored , and Don Pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
He has an uncle here in Messina who will be glad to hear this news .
No , no , until it comes true we'll pretend it was just a dream we had .
But my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
Go to her and tell her for me .
Cousins , you all have work to do. , Oh , I beg your pardon .
Come with me now , and help me out .
Really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
Therefore my sadness is without limit .
You should listen to reason .
I can't hide what I am .
Sure , but don't do it at full volume until there's no danger in it .
Not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother , and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you .
You have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
I'd rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother's garden .
Though I am not a flattering , righteous man , at least you can say that I am honest about being a villain .
Until that happens , let me be who I am and don't try to change me .
Can't you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
I use it all the time , since it's all that I have .
Who's that ?
What's going on , Borachio ?
Who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
Your brother's right-hand man .
Who ?
That pretty boy , Claudio ?
That's the one .
Hero , the daughter and heir of Leonato .
A lively young one !
How did you learn about this ?
As I was working on one musty room , the Prince and Claudio entered .
Come , let's go to the dance .
This just may cheer me up .
If there's any way I can spoil his life , I'll be overjoyed .
You'll both help me , right ?
Until the day we die , my lord .
Let's go to this great feast .
Lead the way , sir .
Wasn't Don John at dinner tonight ?
I didn't see him .
That man always looks so sour !
Just looking at him gives me heartburn .
He has a very gloomy attitude .
It would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between Don John and Benedick .
One of them is too much like a painting of a man , he never speaks , and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy , always chattering .
So , the man would talk half as much as Benedick and be half as serious as Don John , And if he were handsome , agile , and rich , too , he could have any woman in the world , all he'd need was her good will .
Really , niece , you'll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
Honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
Maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
And then what would I do with him ?
So you'll go to hell ?
No , just to the gates of hell , where the devil will meet me , with the horns on his head like a cuckold , and say , "Go up to heaven , Beatrice .
He will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit , and I'll have fun there forever .
No , I won't take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
What woman wouldn't be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
Can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
No , uncle , I won't be married .
If he is too insistent , tell him that romance is like a dance : it has its own rhythm and timing .
The wooing is like a Scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
Niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
I have a good eye , uncle .
I can see what's in broad daylight .
The partygoers have arrived .
Let's give them room .
My lady , will you have a dance with me ?
As long as you move gracefully , look handsome , and say nothing , I'm yours for the dance .
And when will that be ?
When I like the way you look , for God forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
My mask is like the roof of the poor
If you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
Well , I wish you liked me .
Tell me one .
I say my prayers out loud .
That makes me love you even more .
Amen .
Go ahead , say "Amen." No more talking .
I've got my answer .
No , really , I'm not .
I can tell by the way you waggle your head .
Really , I'm only pretending to be him .
You could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
Look , you've got his wrinkled hands .
You are Antonio , you are he .
In short , I'm not .
Come on , do you think I can't recognize you by your excellent wit ?
Can a good thing hide itself ?
Be quiet , you are Antonio .
A man's virtues will always show themselves , and that's the end of that .
Won't you tell me who told you that ?
No , you'll have to excuse me .
And you won't tell me who you are ?
Not now .
Who said that I was disdainful , and that I got all my best lines out of a bad joke book ? !
Well , it must have been Signior Benedick .
Who's that ?
I'm sure you know him .
No I don't , believe me .
What , he never made you laugh ?
Yes , heavily .
There's no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
And it's definitely better to cry because you're happy than laugh because you're sad !
There was no Signior Montanto in our army .
Who are you talking about , niece ?
My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua .
Oh , yes , Benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
Please tell me , who is this man ?
Why , he's the Prince's fool , and a very dull fool at that .
I'm sure he's out there dancing .
I could have sworn he trampled on me .
When I meet this gentleman , I'll tell him what you've said .
Oh , please do .
And that will save a partridge wing from being eaten , because he'll be too miserable for dinner .
Come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
In every good thing they do .
No , if they try to lead us to harm , I will leave the dance floor at the next song .
That's Claudio .
You know me too well .
I am Benedick .
Sir , my brother is very fond of you .
He is in love with Hero .
Please make him change his mind .
How do you know he loves her ?
I heard him swear he did .
I did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
Come on , let's get to the banquet .
Though I said my name was Benedick , I heard this news with Claudio's ears .
Of course the Prince wants Hero for himself .
Friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
Therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
Beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
Goodbye then , Hero .
Claudio ?
Yes , that's me .
Will you come with me ?
Where ?
Right over to that I hope he enjoys her .
You sound like a cattle dealer : that's the way they sell bulls .
But do you really think the Prince would treat you that way ?
Please , leave me alone .
Look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
A boy robbed you , but you'll beat up the post instead .
If you won't leave , then
Oh , the poor bird .
But how strange that Beatrice should seem to know who I was and yet not know at the same time .
The Prince's fool" !
Maybe they call me that because I am cheerful .
Yes , but I am insulting myself by thinking this way .
I don't have that kind of reputation !
Well , I'll get my revenge .
Now , sir , where is Claudio ?
Did you see him ?
Yes , my lord , I played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
I found him here , Beating ?
Why , what did he do ?
He was like a schoolboy who finds a bird's nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
What , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
The criminal is the one who stole the nest .
Lady Beatrice is angry with you .
The gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her .
She speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
If her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
I wouldn't marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
Please , don't mention her .
Look , here she comes .
Your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
I'll go to the Antipodes for any little errand you can think of .
Really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
So I suppose your grace can truly say that I have lost it .
You've humiliated him , lady : you've put him down .
Why are you so sad ?
I'm not sad , my lord .
What then , sick ?
I'm neither , my lord .
The count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well , he's just civil , as Seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
I've told her father , and he's given his permission .
Tell us when you wish to get married , and may God give you joy .
Claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
The Prince has made the match , and may God bless it .
Speak , Claudio , that's your cue .
For you , I give myself away and I'm ecstatic about the exchange .
Truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
Yes , my lord .
I thank my heart , the poor fool , for it keeps away from seriousness .
Look , my cousin is whispering to Claudio that she loves him .
Why , you're absolutely right , cousin .
Thank the lord for alliances !
So everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because I'm sunburned .
I should sit in the corner and sing that song , "Heigh-Ho for a Husband ! " Lady Beatrice , I'll get you a husband .
I'd rather get a husband from your father .
Don't you have any brothers like you ?
Your father's sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
Will you take me , my lady ?
No , my lord , unless I could have another husband for the work week .
You are too expensive to wear every day .
But please , forgive me , your highness .
I was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
Niece , will you take care of those things I mentioned ?
Oh , yes , I'm sorry , uncle. , If you'll excuse me , your grace .
I swear , she's a very good-natured lady .
There's very little about her that's gloomy , my lord .
She's only sad when she sleeps , and not even then .
She can't stand to hear about getting a husband .
No , not at all .
She mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
She would make a good wife for Benedick .
Oh , Lord , if they were married , they'd drive themselves crazy within a week .
Count Claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
Tomorrow , my lord .
My lord , I will help you , even if it means I have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
Me too , my lord .
And you , sweet Hero ?
I'll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
And Benedick is not the worst husband I can think of .
This much I can say about him : he is well-born , has proven his bravery in battle , and has established his good character .
Come inside with me , and I will tell you my plan .
But I'm sure he'll get even with you .
Signior Benedick served well in the war , my lady .
You had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
He's a good soldier too , lady .
He's a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
He is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
Absolutely , he is stuffed , like a dummy .
Please don't take my niece the wrong way , sir .
Benedick and Beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
Whenever they meet , there's a little battle .
Every month he has a new best friend .
Is that possible ?
It's arranged .
The Count Claudio will marry Leonato's daughter .
Yes , my lord , but I can spoil it .
Any obstacle or barrier to Claudio's happiness will be like medicine to me .
I hate him so much it makes me sick , and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy .
How will you wreck this marriage ?
I can only do it by lying , my lord , but I can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
Quickly , tell me how .
I think it was a year ago that I told you how much Margaret , Hero's servant woman , likes me .
I remember .
I can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out Hero's bedroom window .
How will that kill this marriage ?
That part is up to you .
What will be my evidence ?
Evidence enough to deceive the Prince , anger Claudio , ruin Hero , and kill Leonato .
Is there anything else you wish ?
That's all I want , and I'll do anything to accomplish it .
Find a time to speak with Don Pedro and Claudio alone .
Tell them you know that Hero loves me .
Pretend to be very concerned about both the Prince , who has compromised his honor by making the match , and Claudio , whose reputation will be ruined by this woman who's pretending to be a virgin .
Of course , they won't believe you without proof .
If you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won't fail me .
I'll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
Boy !
Yes Signior ?
In my bedroom window there is a book .
Go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
I'm already here , sir .
I see that you are here , but I'd like you to go there and then come back again .
I knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
I knew him when he would've walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
I'm not sure , but I don't think so .
I can't promise that love won't transform me , but I can promise you this : until I truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
Ha !
Look , it's the Prince and Mr. Love .
I'll hide in the arbor .
Well , should we hear some music ?
Yes , my lord .
Come on , Balthasar , let's hear that song again .
Oh , my good lord , don't make me insult music again with my awful singing .
Come on , please sing .
Just know this before I begin : I can't play a single note that's worthy of note .
Listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
That's a good song .
And a bad singer , my lord .
Yes , do you hear me , Balthasar ?
Please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade Lady Hero at her bedroom window .
I'll do the best I can , my lord .
Please do .
Goodbye .
Come here , Leonato .
What was it that you told me today , that your niece Beatrice was in love with Signior Benedick ?
Oh yes .
I didn't , either .
But how wonderful that she should be so fond of Signior Benedick , whom she has always appeared to hate .
Really , my lord , I don't know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it's past all understanding .
Maybe she's just pretending .
Yes , that's quite likely .
Oh God !
Pretending ?
No one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
Why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
What symptoms , my lord ?
She will have a seat , you heard my daughter tell you how .
Yes , she did tell us .
Please , please tell me !
This is amazing .
I would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
I would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against Benedick .
Has she told Benedick how she feels ?
No , and she swears she never will .
That's what's driving her crazy .
It's true , Hero says so .
My daughter told me everything .
Now that you speak of paper , I remember a funny story of Hero's .
Oh , you mean when Beatrice writes a letter and Hero sees that it has "Benedick" and "Beatrice" written all over it ?
Yes , that's the one .
Oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
It's true .
If she won't tell Benedick , someone else should .
And what would that accomplish ?
He'll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
If he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
She's an excellent , sweet woman , and there's no doubt that she is virtuous .
And she is very smart .
Oh , my lord , when wisdom and passion are in one body , it's ten to one that the passion will win .
I am sorry for her , as I should be , since I am both her uncle and her guardian .
I wish she were in love with me instead .
I would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
Please , tell Benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
Is that a good idea , do you think ?
Hero thinks Beatrice will surely die , for she says she'll die if he doesn't love her , and that she'll die before she tells him , and she'll die if he woos her and she's made to hold back even one of her usual insults .
She's probably right .
If she offers him her love , it's very possible that he'll scorn it , since , as we all know , he tends to be contemptuous .
He's a very proper man .
And I swear to God he's very smart .
He does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
It's entirely possible .
I can see you don't like this gentleman .
No , absolutely not .
But please tell me , who's his best friend ?
He spends most of his time with the good , noble Claudio .
Oh God , Benedick will plague him like a disease !
God help Claudio !
If he's caught the Benedick , he'll lose all his money before he's cured .
I'm going to make sure I stay on your good side , lady .
Do that , my friend .
You will never fall victim to Benedick's charms , my niece .
No , not until we see a hot January .
Don Pedro is here .
If he fears God , he must necessarily keep the peace .
If he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
Well , I'm sorry for your niece .
Should we go find Benedick and tell him about Beatrice's love ?
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner .
Lovely Beatrice , I thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
If the job had been painful , I would not have come .
So you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
Yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
You don't want to eat , sir ?
Goodbye , then .
Ha !
Against my will , I've been told to bring you in to dinner." There's a double meaning in that .
I didn't take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me." That's like saying , "Any thing I do for you is as easy as saying 'thank you.'" If this doesn't move me to take pity on her , I'm a horrible person .
If I don't love her , I'm completely
Margaret , run into the sitting room .
You'll find Beatrice there , talking to Claudio and the Prince .
Whisper to her that Ursula and I are walking in the orchard and that we're talking all about her .
Tell her you heard us , and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun .
She can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
This is your job .
Do it well , and then leave us .
I'll make her come right away , I promise you .
All right Ursula , as Beatrice arrives , we'll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but Benedick .
Whenever I mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
It'll be my job to talk about how Benedick is sick with love for Beatrice .
Let's start .
But are you sure that Benedick loves Beatrice that much ?
That's what the Prince and my fiance say .
And did they ask you to tell Beatrice about this , madam ?
They did want me to tell her , but I persuaded them that , if they truly loved Benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep Beatrice in the dark .
Why did you do that ?
Doesn't Benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with Beatrice ?
What's the matter , lieutenant ?
I'll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
You'll beat me ?
Are you talking , you villain ?
No , don't hit him , lieutenant !
Please , sir , restrain yourself .
Let me go , or I'll knock you on the head .
Come on , you're drunk .
Drunk ?
No , lieutenant , God , gentlemen , Help , Lieutenant , sir , Montano , Help , men ! , The night guard is coming !
Who's sounding that alarm ?
The whole town will riot !
You'll be ashamed of this forever !
What is the matter here ?
I'll kill him !
Stop right now !
Stop !
Stop !
The general is talking to you !
Stop , for God's sake !
For heaven's sake , stop this savage brawl !
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies .
Stop that alarm from ringing , it's scaring the islanders .
What's the matter here , gentlemen ? , Honest Iago , you look upset .
Answer me .
I don't know .
I don't
I'd rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
You're famous for it .
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
Tell me .
Othello , I've been seriously hurt .
I didn't do anything wrong that I know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .
All right , now I'm starting to lose my cool .
That's unbelievably bad .
Iago , who started it ?
You're hitting close to home there .
I'd rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio .
But I don't think it'll hurt him to tell the truth .
They were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
I can't tell you anything else .
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano , who was only trying to help him , but I'm sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way , and Cassio couldn't let it pass .
I'll make you an example for the others to learn from .
What's the matter , dear ?
Everything's fine , now , sweetheart .
Are you hurt , lieutenant ?
Yes , but no doctor can help me .
Oh I hope that's not true !
You know I'm powerful enough to make you pay for this .
Please wait , sir .
Why are you talking about robbery ?
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter .
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
Your whole family will be ruined .
What kind of crude jerk are you ?
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now .
You're a villain !
You're a senator !
You're going to pay for this , Roderigo .
I know who you are .
I'll answer for everything .
My reputation , my reputation !
Oh , my reputation , Iago , my reputation !
I swear I thought you meant you'd been hurt physically .
Your physical health matters more than your reputation .
You haven't lost it unless you think you have .
There are lots of ways to get on the general's good side again .
Go to him , petition him .
Drunk ?
Babbling senselessly ?
Squabbling ?
Swaggering ?
Ranting and raving to my own shadow !
Oh , wine is the devil !
Who were you chasing with your sword ?
What did he do to you ?
I don't know .
Is that possible ?
I remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
I remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
Why do we party until we're like animals ?
You seem all right now .
How did you get better ?
One weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
Come on , you're being too hard on yourself .
I wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
But since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
I'll ask him for my position back again , and he'll tell me I'm a drunk .
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths , I wouldn't be able to answer that .
I was a reasonable man , then I became a fool , and finally a beast !
Oh , how strange !
Every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil's the main ingredient !
Come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
Don't say anything bad about wine anymore .
Lieutenant , I think you know I'm your friend .
I know that , sir .
Imagine , me , a drunk !
Any man can get drunk sometime .
I'll tell you what to do .
Othello's wife has a lot of influence now .
Ask her to help you get back your position .
She is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it's wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
That's good advice .
I believe it completely .
Early in the morning I'll go visit Desdemona and plead my case .
My situation is desperate .
You're doing the right thing .
Good night , lieutenant .
Good night , honest Iago .
Who can say I'm evil when my advice is so good ?
That's really the best way to win the Moor back again .
It's easy to get Desdemona on your side .
She's full of good intentions .
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what'll do him good ?
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like I'm doing now .
The more she
And that's how I'll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all .
Hello , Roderigo !
I've spent most of my money , and tonight I got beaten up .
So with no money , but a little more wisdom , I'm going back to Venice .
You're a poor man if you're this impatient !
No , it heals gradually .
We achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
Aren't things going well ?
My God , it's morning .
All this excitement has made the time fly by .
Go back to where you're staying and go to sleep .
Go .
Now two things still need to be done .
I'll put her on that .
Yes , that's the way I'll do it .
I'll pay you for your trouble .
Are these wind instruments ?
Yes , they are .
Oh , there's the problem .
What's the problem ?
Well , we'll stop , then .
If you've got any music that can't be heard , then play that .
But as I said , the general isn't really in the mood to hear music now .
We don't have any music that can't be heard .
Then pack up your instruments and go away .
Go !
Do you hear , my friend ?
Please don't play games .
CASSIO She's awake , sir .
If she feels like coming over here , I'll give her your message .
Good to see you , Iago .
You didn't go to sleep , then ?
No .
I'm going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona .
I humbly thank you .
Even for a Good morning , lieutenant .
I'm sorry about what happened , but I'm sure everything will turn out all right .
The general and his wife are talking about it now , and she's defending you strongly .
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you .
But he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he's looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona , if you think that's all right .
Please come in .
I'll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
Thank you very much .
Iago , give these letters to the ship's captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice .
Now that's done , I'm going to walk on the fortification walls .
I will , my lord .
Shall we go see this fortification , men ?
We're at your service , my lord .
I'll do everything I can for you , Cassio .
Please do , madam .
I'm sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
Yes , my lady .
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if I'm gone and someone else has my job .
My husband will never get a moment's rest , I'll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
But if you didn't know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
I'd never play pranks on you .
If she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
Light the candles !
Wake up my whole household !
I dreamt about this .
Give me some light !
It's time for me to say goodbye to you .
It would be inappropriate , dangerous , even , for me to be seen working against the Moor , as I would if I stayed .
of patience .
I'm your advocate , and I'd rather die than give up on you .
Madam , here comes your husband .
Madam , I'd better leave now .
Why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
No , madam .
I'm very uncomfortable , and that won't help my case .
Well , do whatever you think best .
Hey !
I don't like that .
What did you say ?
Nothing , my lord , or if I did , I don't know what .
Wasn't that Cassio leaving my wife ?
Cassio , my lord ?
I really think it was him .
What's this , my lord ?
I was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who's suffering from your anger .
Who do you mean ?
Your lieutenant , Cassio .
Oh , if I've got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him .
Please call him and tell him to come back here .
Was that him just now ?
Yes .
My love , call him back in here .
Not now , my sweet Desdemona .
Some other time .
But will it be soon ?
Very soon , because you want it .
Will it be tonight at supper ?
No , not tonight .
Then tomorrow at dinner ?
Well then , tomorrow night , or Tuesday morning .
Or Tuesday noon or at night , or Wednesday morning .
Please just name a time , but don't wait more than three days .
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place , though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .
So when should he come ?
Tell me , Othello .
I swear , I could do so much , Please , no more .
I won't refuse you anything .
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it's cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that's good for you .
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it'll be something difficult and terrible .
I won't deny you anything !
But in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
Would I ever deny you anything ?
No .
Goodbye , my husband .
Goodbye , my Desdemona .
I'll come see you right away .
God help me , I love you !
My noble lord , What is it , Iago ?
When you were wooing Desdemona , did Michael Cassio know about it ?
Yes , he knew about it the whole time .
Why do you ask ?
Why are you curious , Iago ?
I didn't realize he knew her .
Oh , really ?
Oh , really ?
Yes , really .
Do you see something wrong with that ?
Isn't he an honest man ?
Honest , my lord ?
Honest , yes , honest .
As far as I know , sir .
What are you thinking ?
Thinking , my lord ?
Thinking , my lord ? " My God , you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud .
You're thinking something .
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn't like it when Cassio left my wife .
What didn't you like ?
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona , you were like , "Oh , really ? " And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .
If you're my friend , tell me what you're thinking .
My lord , you know I'm your friend .
I think you are .
As for Michael Cassio , I think it would be safe for me to swear that he's honest .
I think so too .
If they're not honest , they shouldn't look like they are !
Absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
In that case , I think Cassio's an honest man .
No , I think there's more to this than you're letting on .
Please tell me what you're thinking , even your worst suspicions .
You want me to say what I'm thinking ?
You're not being a good friend , Iago , if you even Please don't ask me to tell you .
What are you talking about ?
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have , men and women alike .
If you steal my money , you're just stealing trash .
It's something , it's nothing : it's yours , it's mine , and it'll belong to thousands more .
But if you steal my reputation , you're robbing me of something that doesn't make you richer , but makes me much poorer .
I'm going to find out what you're thinking .
You can't find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn't make me tell you .
What ?
Beware of jealousy , my lord !
It's a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
Oh , what misery !
The person who's poor and contented is rich enough .
God , help us not be jealous !
Why are you telling me this ?
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
No .
If there's any doubt , there is no doubt .
If you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you're not making me jealous .
When a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
So please listen to me .
I'm not talking about proof yet .
Watch out !
I know the people of Venice well .
They let God see things they wouldn't show their husbands .
Do you really think so ?
That's right , she did .
Well , there you go .
She was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
But I'm sorry I've blurted all this out .
I beg your pardon for loving you too much .
I'm indebted to you forever .
You seem a little depressed about this .
Not at all , not at all .
Really , I'm afraid you are .
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you .
But I see you're troubled .
Please don't take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
I won't .
If you take it too seriously , it'll have bad effects that I didn't want it to have .
Cassio's a good friend of mine , My lord , I can see you're upset .
No , not too upset .
Goodbye , goodbye .
If you see anything else , let me know .
Tell your wife to watch her .
Leave me alone now , Iago .
My lord , I'll say goodbye now .
and affection , even if it's just an act .
He and I will be there .
It's true .
She's gone .
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
Now , Roderigo , where did you see her ? , Oh , that miserable wretch ! , You say you saw her with the Moor ? , Oh , who would want to be a father ? , How did you know it was her ? , To think she tricked me so easily ! , What did she say to you ? , Get me more candles , and wake up all my relatives .
Do you think they're married ?
Yes , I really think so .
Oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
My own flesh and blood rebels against me !
Fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
Have you ever heard of anything like that , Roderigo ?
Yes , sir , I have .
I think I can find him .
giving it back to him .
That will tell you a lot .
But in the meantime , just assume that I'm paranoid , as I'm pretty sure I am , and keep thinking she's innocent , please .
Don't worry about how I handle it .
I'll say goodbye once more .
This Iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
If it turns out that she really is running around on me , I'll send her away , even though it'll break my heart .
Oh what a curse marriage is !
I'd rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love , sharing the rest of her with others .
This is the plague of important men , our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
It's our destiny , like death .
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
Oh , here she comes .
If she's cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
I don't believe it .
What's going on , Othello , darling ?
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
I'm sorry .
Why are you whispering ?
Are you sick ?
I have a That's from lack of sleep .
It'll go away .
Let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
Come on , I'll escort you to dinner .
I'm very sorry you're not feeling well .
hundred times .
But she loves it so much ( since Othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
I'll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago .
Heaven knows what he's going to do with it .
What's going on ?
What are you doing here alone ?
Don't snap at me .
I've got something for you .
You've got something for me ?
It's a common What ?
to have a stupid wife .
Oh , is that so ?
And what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
What handkerchief ?
What handkerchief ?
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
You stole it from her ?
She dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since I was here , I picked it up .
Look , here it is .
Good girl , give it to me .
And what are you going to do with it ?
What's it to you ?
If you don't need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
Poor lady , she'll go crazy when she sees it's missing .
Now go , leave me .
The Moor's mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
Here he comes .
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
She's cheating on me ?
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
What's with you , my lord ?
I had no idea she was cheating on me .
I never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me .
I slept well , ate well , and was happy .
I never saw Cassio's kisses on her lips .
A man who's robbed , but doesn't miss what's stolen , isn't robbed at all .
I'm sorry to hear this .
I would've been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest-ranking grunts and all , as long as I didn't know anything about it .
Oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
Goodbye to my happiness !
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
Goodbye !
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war !
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
Othello's career is over .
Is this possible , my lord ?
Has it come to this ?
Show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
Oh , heaven help me !
Aren't you a rational human being ?
Don't you have any sense at all ?
Goodbye .
What a horrible world we live in !
It's not safe to be straightforward and honest .
No , stop .
You should always be honest .
I should always be wise .
I swear , I think my wife's faithful , and I think she's not .
I think you're trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
I need proof !
Her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it's as dirty and black as my own face .
As long as there are
I see you're all eaten up with emotion .
I'm sorry I said anything .
You want proof ?
Want ?
Yes , I want it , and I'll get it .
But how ?
How will you get proof ?
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
Death and damnation !
Oh !
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
What can I say ?
What proof is there ?
It'd be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
Give me one good reason to think she's cheating on me .
I don't like what you're asking me to do .
But since I've gotten myself involved this far , because I'm so stupidly honest and because I like you so much , I'll keep going .
I recently shared a bed with Cassio , and I couldn't sleep because of a raging toothache .
Monstrous !
No , it was just a dream .
It's a reason for suspicion , even though it's just a dream .
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
I'll tear her to pieces !
Just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ?
If it's the same one , If it's the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it's pretty strong .
Oh , I'd kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could !
Killing him once is not enough revenge .
Now I see it's true .
My heart feels like it's full of poisonous snakes !
Be patient , I'm telling you .
You may change your mind later .
Never , Iago .
I swear to God I'll get revenge .
Don't get up yet .
Let heaven be my witness , I'm putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in Othello's control .
Let him command me , and I'll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
I accept your devotion with my deepest love .
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio's dead .
But let her live .
Oh , damn her , damn her !
Come away with me .
I'm going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
You're my lieutenant now .
I'm yours forever .
Lead the way .
I'll stop at every house .
I'll reward you for your troubles .
Why do you say that ?
Oh , come on .
Where does he sleep ?
Telling you where he's sleeping is like telling you where I'm lying .
What on earth does that mean ?
I don't know where he's staying , so if I told you he's sleeping here or there , I'd be lying .
Can you ask around and find out ?
Find him and tell him to come here .
Tell him I've spoken to my husband on his behalf , and I think everything will be all right .
I think I can do that .
Where could I have lost that handkerchief , Emilia ?
I don't know , madam .
Believe me , I'd rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he wasn't so free of jealousy .
He's not jealous ?
Who , him ?
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
Look , here he comes .
I won't leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back. , How are you , my lord ?
Hot , hot and moist .
With a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
It's a nice hand , an open one .
But these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
I don't know about that .
Now , don't forget , you promised me something .
What did I promise , my dear ?
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you .
I have a bad cold that's bothering me .
Lend me your handkerchief .
Here , my lord .
No , the one I gave you .
I don't have it with me .
You don't ?
No , my lord .
That's not good .
almost read people's thoughts .
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her , my father would love and desire her .
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married .
I did .
Is that possible ?
Yes , it's true .
There's magic in its fabric .
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
The silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
Really ?
Is that true ?
It's absolutely true , so take good care of it .
I wish I had never seen it !
Ha !
Why ?
Why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
Is it lost ?
Is it gone ?
Tell me , is it missing ?
God help me !
What do you have to say for yourself ?
It's not lost , but what if it were ?
What do you mean ?
I'm telling you , it's not lost .
Please hire Cassio again .
Bring me the handkerchief , My mind is full of doubt .
Come on .
The handkerchief !
Damn it !
And you say he's not jealous ?
I never saw him like this before .
They're like stomachs and we're just the food .
They eat us up hungrily , and when they're full , they vomit us up .
Look , here comes Cassio and my husband .
There's no other way .
She's the one who's got to do it .
Go ahead and ask her .
Then I could stop wondering , and find some other career .
If his face changed as much as his personality has , I wouldn't recognize him .
God knows I have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
You'll just have to be patient for a little while .
I'll do what I can , more than I'd do for myself .
Let that be enough for you .
Is Othello angry ?
Can he even get angry ?
If he's angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
Please , do so .
There must be some political news from Venice , or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood .
That's the way it goes .
We shouldn't expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
I hope to God it's something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
Oh no !
I never gave him reason to be jealous .
But jealous people don't think like that .
They're never jealous for a reason ; they're just jealous .
It's like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello's mind !
Amen to that , lady .
I'll go look for him , Cassio , stay around here .
If he's in a good mood I'll mention you again , and do everything I can .
I thank you , lady .
Hello , Cassio !
Why are you so far from home ?
How are you , my pretty Bianca ?
To tell you the truth , I was just going to your house .
And I was just going to yours .
You've kept away from me for a week ?
Seven days and seven nights ?
A hundred and sixty-eight hours ?
And lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
What a tedious wait !
Oh , Cassio , where did you get this ?
Has it come to this ?
Well , well .
Oh , come on , woman .
Well , whose is it ?
It's pretty .
So I'd like it copied .
Take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
Leave you alone !
Why ?
I'm waiting here for the general , and I don't want him to see me with a woman .
And why's that ?
It's not because I don't love you .
But you don't love me .
Please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if I'll see you later tonight .
I can only walk a little way with you , since I'm waiting here .
But I'll see you soon .
All right , have it your way .
I have to make do .
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs .
It's better that you didn't kill him .
But he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself .
But please tell me , sir , is your marriage Let him do his worst .
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
Do you really think so ?
What do you mean , do I think so ?
What , just because they kissed in private ?
An illicit kiss !
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they didn't do anything .
Naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
Come on , Iago .
As long as they didn't do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief , Then what ?
Her reputation is also her own .
Can she give that away too ?
But a handkerchief , God , I wish I could forget about the handkerchief !
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare , he's got my handkerchief !
Yes , what about it ?
That's not good .
What if I'd said I saw him do something to hurt you ?
Yes , but he'd deny it all .
What did he say ?
He said he did , I don't know .
He was in bed with , With her ?
With her , on top of her , however you want to say it .
In bed with her ?
On top of her ?
My God , it's nauseating !
Handkerchief , confessions , handkerchief !
Noses , ears , lips .
Is it possible ?
This is the way to trick gullible fools .
Hey , Cassio !
What's the matter ?
This is his second fit like this .
He had one yesterday .
Rub his temples .
No , don't .
If you interrupt it , he'll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
Look , he's moving .
Why don't you go away for a bit ?
When he leaves , it's very important that I talk to you .
What happened , general ?
Did you hit your head ?
Are you making fun of me ?
I wish you could face your bad news like a man !
He's subhuman , like an animal .
Did he confess ?
Sir , be a man .
Your case is better than that .
Then I'll know exactly what she is , just as I know what I am .
You're wise !
That's for sure .
While you were dazed by grief , which isn't appropriate for a man like you , Cassio showed up here .
I got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
I'll make him tell me the whole story again , where , how often , how long ago , and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future .
I'm telling you , just watch his face .
But stay calm , and don't get carried away by rage , or I'll think you're not a man .
Do you hear what I'm saying , Iago ?
Will you go hide ?
Now I'll ask Cassio about Bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
That's the whore's curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one .
Whenever he talks about her he can't stop laughing .
And when he laughs , Othello will go crazy .
In his ignorant jealousy , he'll totally misunderstand Cassio's smiles , gestures , and jokes. , How are you , lieutenant ?
The poor thing !
He's laughing already !
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
The poor thing , I really think she loves me .
Now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
Have you heard this , Cassio ?
He's asking him to tell the story again .
Go on , tell it .
She says you're going to marry her .
Are you ?
Ha , ha , ha !
Do you think you've won ?
Me , marry her ?
That whore ?
Please give me a little credit !
I'm not that stupid .
Ha , ha , ha !
So , so , so , so !
You're kidding !
All right , then .
She thinks I'll marry her because she loves me .
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
Now he's telling the story .
She was here just now .
She hangs around me all the time .
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
Ha , ha , ha !
Now he's saying how she took him into our bedroom .
Look out , here she comes .
Damn you !
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
I was an idiot to take it !
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
That was a likely story , that you found it in your room and didn't know who it belonged to .
This is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?
What is it , my dear Bianca ?
What's wrong ?
My God , that's my handkerchief !
If you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
If you don't want to , then good riddance .
Go after her , go .
Actually , I should .
Will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
Yes , I will .
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
Oh Iago !
And did you see the handkerchief ?
Was it mine ?
It was yours , I swear .
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
She gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight .
Oh , she's a fine woman !
A fair woman !
A sweet woman !
No , you have to forget all that now .
Yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
Oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
But that's not how you're going to be .
She's so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
Oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
Oh , she's so witty and creative !
All the worse that she stooped this low , then .
Oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times , and what a sweet personality she has !
Yes , a little too sweet .
Yes , that's for sure .
Oh , it's dreadful , dreadful , Iago !
If you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
I'll chop her into pieces .
Oh , it's horrible of her .
That's worse .
Get me some poison tonight , Iago .
I won't argue with her , so her beautiful body won't disarm me. , Tonight , Iago .
Don't do it with poison .
Strangle her in her bed , the same bed she's contaminated .
Good , good , I like that , it's only fair !
Very good !
And let me kill Cassio .
You'll hear more from me by midnight .
Excellent , good .
That's her father and his friends , who've been roused out of bed .
You'd better go inside .
No , I must let them find me .
My good qualities , my legal status as Desdemona's husband , and my innocence will protect me .
Is it them ?
I don't think so .
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant ?
Hello , everyone !
What's going on ?
He needs to see you right away .
What do you think he wants ?
Something about Cyprus .
I think it's important .
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke's already .
They're very anxious for you to get there .
When you weren't at home , the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
It's good you found me .
I'll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I'll go with you .
What's that trumpet for ?
I think someone's coming from Venice .
Look , your wife is with him .
Greetings , good general !
The duke and senators of Venice greet you .
What's new , cousin Lodovico ?
Very nice to see you , sir .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Thank you .
How is lieutenant Cassio ?
Well , he's alive .
Are you sure of that ?
Excuse me ?
He didn't say anything , he's reading .
So there's a rift between Othello and Cassio ?
Yes , unfortunately .
I'd do anything to bring them back together , since I really care for Cassio .
Damn it all !
Excuse me , my lord ?
Are you in your right mind ?
Is he angry ?
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place .
I'm happy about that .
Oh , are you really !
My lord ?
I'm glad you're insane enough to admit it in front of me .
Why , sweet Othello , I haven't done anything to deserve this !
My lord , no one will believe this in Venice , even though I'd swear I saw it with my own eyes .
That was too much .
She's crying .
Oh , you devil , you devil !
Get out of my sight !
I wouldn't want to stay here and make you angry .
She's obedient , a fine lady .
Please , my lord , call her back .
Madam !
My lord ?
What do you want with her , sir ?
Who , me ?
See how well she can turn ?
She can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
And she can cry , sir , oh , how she can cry !
Very obedient , keep crying. , Concerning this , oh , what fake emotion ! , I am being ordered home , Get away from me , I'll send for you later. , Sir , I'll obey the order and return to Venice .
Cassio can have my job .
And tonight , sir , I invite you have dinner with me .
Welcome to Cyprus .
Horny animals !
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
He's changed a great deal .
Is he sane ?
Is he losing his mind ?
He is what he is .
I won't say anything negative about what he might be .
If he isn't what he might be , then I wish to God he were !
Hitting his wife ?
It's true , that wasn't such a nice thing to do .
But I wish I could say that's the last time he'll do it !
Is it a habit of his ?
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he's done it ?
Oh , it's too bad !
It wouldn't be right for me to tell you everything I've seen and heard .
Just go after him and watch what he does next .
I'm sorry I was so wrong about him .
You haven't seen anything , then ?
No , and I didn't hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
But you've seen her and Cassio together .
Yes , but I didn't see anything wrong , and I heard every syllable they said .
Didn't they ever whisper ?
Never , my lord .
Or ask you to leave the room ?
Never .
Not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
No , my lord .
That's strange .
I'd swear to you on my soul that she's a good , honest person , sir .
Tell her to come here .
Go .
She says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
I've seen her do it .
My lord , what do you want ?
Please , dear , come here .
What can I do for you ?
Let me see your eyes .
Look at my face .
What horrible thing are you imagining ?
I can tell you're furious , but I don't understand what you're saying .
Go ahead , swear to that , so you'll be damned to hell for lying .
Heaven knows I am .
Heaven knows you're as unfaithful as hell .
Unfaithful , my lord ?
With whom ?
How am I unfaithful ?
Leave me alone , Desdemona , go away !
Because of me ?
If you've been ordered back to Venice because of my father , don't blame me .
You may have lost his respect , but so have I .
Even that I could put up with .
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
Worse than that , she's polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce !
Even the goddess of patience couldn't look at this and be patient , it's too horrifying !
I hope you think I'm faithful to you .
As faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
Oh , I wish you'd never been born !
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it ?
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
What have you done ?
What have you done ?
Oh , you streetwalker !
What have you done ?
You brazen whore !
I swear to God you're accusing me wrongly !
So you're saying you're not a whore ?
No , I'm as honest as I am Christian .
What , you're not a whore ?
No , I swear it .
Is that possible ?
Oh , heaven help us !
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello. , You whorehouse-keeper .
You !
We've finished our business .
Here's some money for you .
Please lock the door and keep quiet .
What's he talking about ?
How are you , madam ?
Ensign , what's he doing in there ?
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
If he can keep it , he'll be set forever .
I don't understand .
He's married .
To whom ?
Here comes another group looking for you .
It's Brabantio .
He intends to do something bad to you .
Hey !
Stop right there !
Sir , it's the Moor .
Get him , he's a thief !
With who ?
I don't have a lord .
Don't talk to me , Emilia .
Things have certainly changed !
It's fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
What can I do for you , madam ?
How are you ?
I don't know .
When grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
He might have treated me like that , because I'm as unused to abuse as a little child .
What's the matter , lady ?
He called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can't stand to hear it .
Am I that name , Iago ?
What name , madam ?
What my lord said I was .
Why did he do that ?
I don't know .
I just know I'm not one .
Don't cry , don't cry .
What a day this is !
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ?
Doesn't that make you want to cry ?
It's just my bad luck .
Damn him !
How did he get such an idea ?
Heaven knows .
I bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position .
I bet my life on it .
Nobody's that bad .
It's impossible .
If there is , then heaven help him !
Why should he call her a whore ?
Who's been with her ?
The Moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
Oh , I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !
Keep your voice down .
Oh , to hell with those people !
It's the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I'd cheated on you with the Moor .
You're a fool .
Shut up .
Oh God , Iago , what can I do to win my husband back again ?
Please go to him , my friend .
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me .
Here I'm kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me , either by thoughts or actions , or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else , or if I never did love him , or don't love him now , even though he tries to shake me off ,
then I hope I have a life of misery !
Unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it'll never destroy my love .
I can't say "whore." It makes me sick to say the word even now .
Political business is bothering him , and he's just taking it out on you .
If only that were all it is , It is , I promise .
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
The Venetians are waiting for their food .
Go in , and don't cry .
Everything will be all right .
How are you , Roderigo ?
I don't think you're treating me fairly .
What makes you say that ?
Well , I won't take it any longer .
Will you listen to me , Roderigo ?
Your words and actions don't match up .
That's not fair .
It's the truth .
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would've made even a nun want to sleep with me .
You told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens .
Well , all right then .
Fine .
Fine ! " he says .
All right ! " It's not fine , and I'm not all right !
It's wrong , and I'm starting to realize I'm being cheated !
Okay .
It's not okay !
I'm going to tell Desdemona my feelings .
If she returns my jewels , I'll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
If not , I'll challenge you to a duel .
You've said what you have to say now .
Yes , and I'll do everything I just said .
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before .
Give me your hand , Roderigo .
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but I still insist I've done everything I could to help you .
It doesn't look that way to me .
I admit it doesn't look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you're smart .
But Roderigo , if you're as courageous and determined as I think you are , then wait just a bit longer .
If you're not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night , then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me .
Well , what's your plan ?
Is it feasible ?
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus .
Is that true ?
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice .
What do you mean , get rid of him ?
I mean knock his brains out , so he can't take Othello's place .
And that's what you want me to do !
Yes , if you want to help yourself .
He's having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and I'll go visit him .
He doesn't know he's been appointed governor yet .
When you see him walking by here ( as I'll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him .
I'll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
I'll give you such reasons for killing him that you'll feel obliged to snuff him out .
It's nearly dinner time , and the night's going to be wasted .
Let's go !
I want to hear more about this .
You will .
Please , sir , don't trouble yourself .
Good night , madam .
Thank you .
You're most welcome .
Would you walk out with me , sir ? , Oh , Desdemona , Yes , my lord ?
Go to bed right this minute .
I'll be there shortly .
I will , my lord .
How are things now ?
He looks calmer than he did before .
Send me away ?
That's what he said .
So give me my nightgown , Emilia , and I'll say goodnight .
We shouldn't displease him .
Yes .
I wish you'd never met him .
That's not what I wish .
I love him even when he's harsh and mean , Help me unpin this , would you ? , I love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods .
I put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
It doesn't matter .
Oh , how silly we are !
If I die before you do make sure I'm wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
Listen to you !
Don't be silly !
She knew an old song called "Willow" that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it .
I can't get that song out of my head tonight .
It's all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary .
Please , hurry up .
Should I get your nightgown ?
No , just help me unpin this .
That Lodovico is a good-looking man .
He's very handsome .
He speaks well .
I know a lady in Venice who'd walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him .
It's the wind .
My eyes itch , is that an omen I'll be crying soon ?
No , it doesn't mean anything .
I heard someone say that's what it means .
Oh , these men , these men !
Do you honestly think , tell me , Emilia , there are women who'd cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?
There are women like that out there , no question .
You , Roderigo !
Come on , I'll fight you .
Sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
You evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
You devil , you've put a spell on her !
It's obvious to everyone that you've tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
If he struggles , use force !
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
Why , wouldn't you ?
By the light of heaven , no , I would not !
I wouldn't either , by daylight .
It would be easier to do it in the dark .
Could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
The world's huge .
It's a big prize for such a small sin .
I don't think you would .
Actually I think I would , and then I'd undo it after I did it .
I wouldn't do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats .
But for the whole world ?
Who wouldn't cheat on her husband to make him king ?
I'd risk my soul for that .
I'd never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
Why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you've won the whole world , it's a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
I don't think any woman like that exists .
Yes , a dozen of them , as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
But I do think it's the husband's fault if we wives cheat on them .
For instance , our husbands
We have feelings .
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
They see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
I think they do .
Is it out of lust ?
I think so .
Is it a weakness ?
It is .
And don't we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ?
Then tell them to treat us well .
Good night , good night .
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that , not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it !
Here , stand behind this wall ; he'll come right away .
Quick , quick .
Don't be afraid .
I'll be right next to you .
This will either make us or break us .
I'm right behind you .
Be bold , and get ready .
I don't really want to do this , but he's given me good reasons .
I guess it's only one man , no big deal .
I know the sound of his walk. , Die , villain !
Oh , I'm dead !
I'll be crippled forever !
Help !
Murder !
murder !
That's Cassio's voice .
Iago has kept his word .
Oh , what a villain I am !
That's the truth .
Help me !
Get some light !
Get me a surgeon !
It's him !
Brave Iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
You teach me how I should act .
Whore , your lover's dead now , and you'll be going to hell soon .
I'm coming , slut !
I've shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
You've already stained our sheets with your lust ; now I'll stain them with your whore's blood .
Help !
Isn't there a guard around ?
No one passing by ?
Murder !
Murder !
Something's wrong , the man sounds panicked .
Oh , help !
Listen !
I've acted like such a villain !
Two or three men are groaning .
But it's dark out , and it could be a trap .
It's not safe to go near them till we get more help .
Nobody's coming ?
I'll bleed to death .
Look !
Here's someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
Who's there ?
Who's shouting "murder" ?
We don't know .
Didn't you hear someone shouting ?
I'm here , here !
For heaven's sake , help me !
He's a good man .
Is that you , Iago ?
I'm here , I've been destroyed by villains !
Help me .
Oh , lieutenant !
What villains did this to you ?
I think one of them is nearby and can't get away .
That's one of them .
Damned Iago !
You inhuman dog !
Killing men in the dark ?
Where are these murderers ?
Are you good or evil ?
Judge for yourself .
Signor Lodovico ?
That's me .
I beg your pardon .
Cassio's been wounded .
Cassio !
How are you doing , brother ?
My leg's been cut in two .
God forbid !
Bring me some light , gentlemen , I'll bind the wound with my shirt .
What's the matter ?
Who's shouting ?
Who's shouting ?
Oh , my dear Cassio !
My sweet Cassio !
Oh , Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
You notorious whore !
Cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
No .
I'm sorry to find you like this .
I've been looking all over for you .
He's fainted !
Oh Cassio , Cassio , Cassio !
Sir , I believe this piece of trash , Bianca , has something to do with all this trouble. , Hang in there , Cassio. , Come here , bring the light .
Do you recognize this face ?
That's the one , sir .
Do you know him ?
Know him ?
Yes .
I'm glad to see you .
How are you doing , Cassio ? , Someone bring me a stretcher !
Roderigo !
It's him , it's him .
Good , here's the stretcher .
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
I'll get the general's surgeon .
There wasn't any problem .
I don't even know him .
Keep an eye on her .
Do you see ?
The guilty speak volumes even when they're silent .
What's the matter ?
What's the matter , husband ?
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped .
He's near death , and Roderigo's dead already .
Oh , no , good gentleman !
Oh no , good Cassio !
This is what happens when you visit whores .
Please , Emilia , ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight. ,
He ate at my house , but that doesn't make me nervous .
Oh , did he ?
I order you to come with me .
Go to hell , you whore !
As moral as me !
Damn you !
Gentlemen , let's go make sure Cassio's wounds are properly dressed. , Come on , ma'am , you can tell us another story .
Emilia , go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened. , Will you please go now ?
To prison , until you're called into court .
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
It's true .
The Duke's in a meeting right now , and he's sent for you too .
The Duke's in a meeting ?
At this time of night ?
Bring him with us .
The law's on my side .
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .
If we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
I have to do it , I have to do it .
But I won't shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble .
But she's got to die , or she'll cheat on other men .
Put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
If I extinguish the candle , I can light it again if I regret it .
When I've plucked this rose , I can't make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die .
Who's there ?
Othello ?
Yes , Desdemona .
Will you come to bed , my lord ?
Yes , my lord .
Oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
Be quick about it .
I'll wait over here .
I don't want to kill you before you've readied your soul .
No , I don't want to send your soul to hell when I kill you .
You're talking about killing ?
Yes , I am .
Then heaven have mercy on me .
Amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
If you really feel that way , then I hope you won't kill me .
Hmmph !
I don't know why I should be afraid , since I haven't done anything wrong .
But I'm still afraid .
Think of your sins .
My only sin was loving you too much .
Yes , that's why you have to die .
You're wrong to kill me for loving you .
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
You're shaking with emotion .
These are bad omens , but I hope , I hope , they don't predict my future .
I will .
What's this all about ?
You gave that handkerchief , the one I loved and gave to you , to Cassio .
No , I swear by my life and soul !
Bring him here and ask him .
You're on your deathbed .
But I'm not dying yet !
Yes , right now .
So confess your sin freely now .
You're going to die .
Then heaven have mercy on me !
Amen to that .
And you have mercy on me too !
I never gave him any token of romantic love .
I saw him holding the handkerchief !
You liar , you're turning my heart to stone , and making me call what I'll do murder , when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice !
I saw the handkerchief .
He's already done so .
What , my lord ?
That he had sex with you .
What ?
Yes .
He wouldn't say that .
No .
Honest Iago's arranged that .
What , is he dead ?
If he had as many lives as he's got hairs on his head , I would've killed them all in revenge .
Oh , he's been betrayed , and I've been ruined .
Send me away , my lord , but don't kill me !
Kill me tomorrow , but let me live tonight .
No , if you struggle with me , Just half an hour !
Just let me say one prayer !
It's too late .
What's that noise ?
Aren't you dead yet ?
Who's there ?
Yes , it's Emilia .
What's the matter with you now ?
Yes , just now , my lord .
Cassio's killed a young Venetian named Roderigo .
Roderigo's been killed ?
And Cassio's killed ?
No , Cassio wasn't killed .
Cassio's not dead ?
Then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
Oh , I've been murdered unfairly !
Oh Lord , who's that crying ?
That ?
What ?
Oh , no , that was my lady's voice .
Help !
Help !
Oh , lady , speak again .
Sweet Desdemona !
Oh sweet mistress , speak !
I'm dying an innocent woman .
Oh , who did this thing ?
No one .
I did it myself .
Give my love to my kind husband .
Oh , goodbye !
Why , how could she have been murdered ?
My God , who knows ?
You heard her say it wasn't me .
Yes , she said that .
I must go report what happened .
She was lying even as she was going down to hell .
I did kill her .
Then she was even more an angel , and you're an even blacker devil !
She cheated on me , and she was a whore .
You slander her , you devil .
She was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
She was utterly true to you !
Ask your husband if you doubt me .
If I didn't have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell .
Your husband knew about everything .
My husband !
Your husband .
He said she was unfaithful ?
Yes , with Cassio .
If she'd been faithful to me , I never would have given her up , not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her .
My husband .
Yes , he's the one who first told me about her .
He's an honest man who detests evil actions .
My husband ?
Why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
I'm telling you , your husband .
Oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
My husband said she was unfaithful !
Yes , him , woman .
I said "your husband." , Do you understand that word ?
My friend , your husband , the honest , honest Iago .
If he said that , then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
He's lying through his teeth !
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
Ha !
Go ahead , do your worst .
You weren't good enough for her .
You'd better shut up !
Oh , you idiot !
You stupid fool !
As dumb as dirt !
I'll tell everyone what you did , even if it
The Moor's killed my mistress !
Murder , murder !
What's the matter ?
What's going on here , general ?
Oh , are you here , Iago ?
You've done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
What's the matter ?
I told him what I thought .
But did you tell him she cheated on him ?
I did .
Then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
I swear on my soul it was a lie .
You said she slept with Cassio .
Did you say Cassio ?
Yes , with Cassio .
Now be quiet .
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed , No , heaven forbid !
You can't trust them .
It's true , they're inconsistent .
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
And mine say a hundred and forty .
And mine say two hundred .
But often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
Yes , we get the idea .
It's a messenger from the warships .
And your lies caused this murder .
I'll kill myself out of grief !
Oh , evil , evil !
Are you crazy ?
I'm ordering you , go home .
Good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
I know I ought to obey my husband , but not now .
Maybe I'll never go home again , Iago !
Oh !
Oh !
Oh !
Yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
She was filthy !
I'm glad your father isn't alive to see this .
him terribly .
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
It's sad , but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times .
Damn it , shut your mouth .
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
If you're smart , you'll go home .
I won't .
Shame on you !
Drawing your sword on a woman ?
Oh , you stupid Moor !
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
He'd begged me to steal it many times .
You evil whore !
You think she gave it to Cassio ?
No , I found it and gave it to my husband .
You piece of filth , you're lying !
I swear I'm not lying .
You absolute villain !
He's killed his wife !
Yes , yes !
Lay me next to my mistress .
He's gone , and his wife's dead .
Kill him rather than let him leave this room .
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
Let it all go .
What did your song mean , lady ?
Can you hear me ?
I'll die like a swan .
They sing when they die .
Here it is .
Uncle , I'm coming out !
Look in on me , and talk with me , or I'll attack even without a weapon .
What's the matter ?
Look , I have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
I've fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
But
who can control his fate ?
I'm not like that now .
Don't be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
This is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
Are you backing away in fear ?
There's no reason to be afraid .
Where would Othello go ? , Oh , look at you !
You're as pale as your nightgown !
When we meet on Judgment Day , that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell , where devils will grab me .
You're cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
Oh you damned villain !
Whip me , you devils , so I don't have to look at this heavenly sight !
Where is that poor rash man ?
You mean the man who used to be Othello ?
Here I am .
Where's that snake ?
Bring the villain forward .
I don't like it that you knew about this , Iago .
Damn it , you're not listening to me !
You told me you hated him .
I do hate
But that's just a fairy tale .
If you are a devil , I won't be able to kill you .
Take his sword away from him .
I'm bleeding , but you didn't kill me .
I'm not sorry , either .
I want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
Say anything .
This poor guy's partly confessed his plan .
Did you plan Cassio's death with him ?
Yes .
Dear general , I never gave you any reason to hate me .
I believe you , and I ask you to forgive me .
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
Don't ask me anything .
You know what you know .
From this moment on , I'll never say another word .
What , not even to pray ?
Well , do your best .
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio .
Oh , you villain !
Ungodly and monstrous !
Oh , you wicked scoundrel !
Cassio , how did you get my wife's handkerchief ?
I found it in my room , and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes .
You're stripped of your power and your command , and Cassio will govern Cyprus .
As for this slave , Iago , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he'll have it .
You'll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government. , Okay , take him away .
But enough about that .
When you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as I am .
Don't tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
If you're being fair , you'll have to describe me as someone who loved too much , but who wasn't wise about it .
Write all this
down , and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian , so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this .
Oh , what a bloody end to all this !
Everything we've heard is bad .
I was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but I didn't think he had a weapon .
What do you think about this change ?
They can't have changed ; there's no way this could be true .
It's a trick to confuse us .
Here's some more news coming in .
That's just what I thought .
How many , can you guess ?
Thirty ships .
Now they've turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus .
Signor Montano , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him .
Then it's certain they're heading for Cyprus .
Is Marcus Luccicos in town ?
No , he's in Florence .
Write to him immediately .
Hurry .
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor .
Forgive me , your grace .
Why , what's the matter ?
It's my daughter !
Oh , my daughter !
Is she dead ?
She's dead to me .
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit , and impose the death penalty if you choose to , even if the criminal were my own son .
I humbly thank you , sir .
We're sorry to hear this .
Nothing , but this is true .
There's nothing more .
I'm awkward in my speech and I'm not a smooth talker .
She blushes at the slightest thing .
The devil must be behind this .
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
Tell us , Othello .
Or did you agree to this as equals ?
of her father .
Bring Desdemona here .
You know where she is .
In the meantime I'll tell you all , as honestly as I confess my sins to God , how I wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me .
Tell us , Othello .
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles I've fought .
When I talked about all these things , Desdemona used to listen attentively .
She said she wished she hadn't heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her .
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she'd fall in love with him .
I took the hint and spoke to her .
She said she loved me for the dangers I'd survived , and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me .
That's the only witchcraft I ever used .
Here comes my wife now .
She'll confirm everything .
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
Please let her speak .
If she admits she wanted this , then I won't blame Othello. , Come here , my child .
Who do you obey here ?
Father , this isn't easy for me .
I'm torn .
You're the one I have to obey .
I'm your daughter .
I'm finished , then .
Duke , please go ahead with your state business .
I'd rather adopt a child than have one of my own. , Come here , Moor .
With all my heart , I give you that thing which , if you didn't already have it , I'd try with all my heart to keep from you .
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant. , I'm done , my lord .
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you can't change something , don't cry about it .
Please , I'm asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet .
She can stay at her father's house .
I won't allow it .
Neither will I .
Dear Duke , please listen to what I have to say .
What do you want to do , Desdemona ?
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him .
I saw Othello's true face when I saw his mind .
Let me go with him .
Please allow her to do this .
You can decide that privately .
What's important is the urgency of this mission .
You'll have to leave tonight .
With all my heart , I'll go right away .
We'll meet again at nine in the morning .
Othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .
He'll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think I might need .
which any peace-lover can do .
His military understanding is all theory , no practice .
And there's nothing I can do about it .
That's the curse of military service .
Now , you tell me : should I feel loyal to the Moor ?
If you don't like him you should quit .
No , calm down .
I'm serving under him to take advantage of him .
We can't all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they're terminated .
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
Let me tell
All right , then .
Treat Desdemona well .
Keep an eye on her , Moor .
She lied to me , and she may lie to you .
Iago , I'm leaving my dear Desdemona with you .
Have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
Come on , Desdemona , I've only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do .
We're on a tight schedule .
Iago .
What do you have to say , noble friend ?
What do you think I should do ?
Go to bed , and sleep .
I'm going to go drown myself .
If you do that , I'll never respect you again .
Why , you silly man !
Oh , how stupid !
I've been alive for twenty-eight years , and I've never met a man who knew what was good for him .
I'd rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can't have .
What should I do ?
I know it's foolish to be so much in love , but I can't help it .
Can't help it ?
Nonsense !
What we are is up to us .
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
Depending on what we plant , weeds or lettuce , or one kind of herb rather than a variety , the garden will either be barren and useless , or rich and productive .
If we didn't have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over .
Thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
I don't believe it .
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
Come on , be a man .
Drown yourself ?
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies , don't drown yourself !
I've told you I'm your friend , and I'll stick by you .
I've never been more useful to you than I will be now .
Here's what you'll do .
Moors are moody people. , So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .
She'll have to have it .
So have your money ready .
If you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
Raise all the money you can .
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl .
And to hell with drowning yourself !
That's completely beside the point .
You can trust me .
Go now and get cash .
I told you before , and I'll tell you again and again : I hate the Moor .
So let's join forces and get revenge .
Go get money .
We'll speak again tomorrow .
Goodbye .
Where will we meet in the morning ?
At my house .
I'll be there early .
No more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
I've changed my mind about that .
Go then , goodbye .
Put a lot of cash together .
I'm going to sell all my land .
That's how I always do it , getting money from fools .
I'd be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn't get something useful out of him .
I hate the Moor , and there's a widespread rumor that he's slept with my wife .
I'm not sure it's true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
He thinks highly of me .
Cassio's a handsome man .
Let's see , how can I
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time ?
How ?
How ?
Let's see .
I've worked it out .
What can you see out on the ocean ?
Nothing .
It was windy on shore too .
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
What do you think will be the result of this storm ?
The Turkish navy will be broken up .
The wind's whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky .
I've never seen the waters so disturbed .
If the Turkish fleet isn't protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
No ship could survive this storm .
I've got news , boys , the war's over !
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined .
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
What ?
Is this true ?
Michael Cassio , lieutenant of the Moor Othello , has arrived on shore .
The Moor himself is still at sea .
I'm happy about that .
He'll be a good governor .
The two of them were separated during the storm .
I hope to God Othello's all right .
Let's do that .
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
Thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello .
I hope heaven protects him from the weather , because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
Is his ship sturdy ?
Yes , it's well built , and the ship's pilot is very expert and experienced .
What's all that shouting about ?
Please go find out for certain who has arrived .
I'll do that .
Good lieutenant , is your general married ?
A man named Iago , the general's ensign .
Who's that ?
Look , the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore .
We should all kneel before her , men of Cyprus !
Greetings , my lady , and may God always be with you .
Thank you , brave Cassio .
Is there any news about my husband ?
He hasn't arrived yet .
As far as I know , he's okay and will arrive here soon .
Oh , but I'm worried .
How did you two get separated ?
The storm separated us .
Go find out the news .
you , as sure as your name's Roderigo , if I were the Moor I wouldn't want to be Iago .
I'm not who I appear to be .
Do it , and shout like the city's on fire .
Hey , Brabantio !
Signor Brabantio , hey !
Thieves !
Thieves !
Check on your daughter , your house , your money !
Thieves !
Thieves !
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you'd be sick of her by now .
She's always talking when I want to sleep .
I admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
You have no reason to say that .
Come on , come on .
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
Shame on you , you slanderer !
No , it's true , or if it's not , I'm a villain .
You wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
No , I don't .
But if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
Don't make me do it , my lady .
I'm critical by nature .
Yes , madam .
I'm not as happy as I seem .
Come on , what would you say about me ?
Very clever !
Even if she's ugly , she'll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her .
This is getting worse and worse !
What if she's pretty but stupid ?
You don't know a thing !
You give your best praise to the worst women .
But how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ?
A woman who was beautiful but never proud , who could speak well but knew when to be quiet , who dressed well but was never overdressed , who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted , a woman who never took revenge , who overlooked it when people hurt her , who was too wise to do anything stupid , who could think without revealing her thoughts , and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her , that kind of woman , if she ever existed , would , Would do what ?
Would raise babies and clip coupons .
Oh , that's pathetic !
Don't listen to him , Emilia , even though he's your husband .
What do you think about him , Cassio ?
Isn't he a horrible man ?
He speaks bluntly , madam .
He's more of a soldier than a wise man .
I recognize his trumpet .
Yes , it is .
Let's go greet him when he lands .
Look , here he comes .
My beautiful warrior !
My darling Othello !
I'm amazed you got here before me .
But I'm overjoyed !
If I died right now I'd be completely happy , since I'll probably never be as happy as this again in my life .
God willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
Amen to that !
I can't talk about my happiness anymore .
It's too much .
Let's go up to the castle .
Good news , friends .
The war's over and the Turks are drowned .
How are my old friends from this island doing ? , Honey , they'll love you here in Cyprus .
And bring the ship's captain to the castle .
He's a good man. , Let's go , Desdemona .
Meet me down at the harbor. , Come here .
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight .
But first , I have to tell you that Desdemona's completely in love with him .
With Cassio ?
That's impossible .
Be quiet and listen to me .
Othello isn't any of those things .
Now , if that's true , and it's obviously true , who's in a better position than Cassio ?
Besides , he's young and handsome , and he's got all the qualities that naive and silly girls go for .
I can't believe that .
She's very moral .
Like hell she is !
If she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place .
Good lord !
Did you see that ?
They were lusting after each other .
Disgusting !
But listen to me ; let me guide you .
I brought you here from Venice .
Be on guard duty tonight .
Cassio doesn't know you .
I'll be nearby .
Make Cassio angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want .
All right .
He's hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
Try to get him to do that .
To get what you want , you need to get Cassio out of the way .
I'll do it , if you help me out .
I promise I will .
Meet me in a little while at the citadel .
I need to get Othello's things from the ship .
Goodbye .
Goodbye .
I won't be satisfied until I get even with him , wife for wife .
If I can't do that , I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can't think straight .
For besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
That's the end of the announcement .
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven .
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello !
Iago's a good man .
Goodnight , Michael .
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can. , Come with me , my dear love .
Good night , everyone .
Hello , Iago .
It's time for us to stand guard .
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona. , I can't blame him .
What's the reason for this horrible shouting ?
What's the matter ?
Sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
Are your doors locked ?
Why are you asking me that ?
For God's sake , sir , you've been robbed .
Your heart's going to break .
It's like half your soul's been ripped out .
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
Wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
Get up , I tell you !
Are you crazy ?
Do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
Not me .
Who are you ?
My name's Roderigo .
I told you not to hang around my house .
I've already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
Sir , sir , sir ,
Yes , she's young and tender .
Like an invitation .
But she's modest and ladylike too .
And when she speaks , doesn't her voice stir up passion ?
She's a perfect woman , it's true .
Well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
Not tonight , Iago .
I'm not much of a drinker .
I wish there was less social pressure to drink .
Oh , but these are our friends .
Just one glass .
I'll do most of the drinking for you .
I've already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk I am .
What are you talking about , man ?
Tonight is for celebrating !
Where are they ?
By the door .
Please invite them in .
I'll do it , but I don't like it .
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he's drunk already , he'll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog .
Now I'll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island .
Here they come .
If the future turns out as I hope it will , I'm all set for success .
My God , they've given me a lot to drink .
No , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
Bring in more wine !
My God , what a great song !
I learned it in England , where they have a talent for drinking .
The Danes , the Germans , and the Dutch , come on , drink , drink ! , are nothing compared to the English .
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
They drink Danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans .
Let's drink to our general !
I'll drink as much as you do !
Oh , sweet England !
God , that song's even better than the other one .
Do you want to hear it again ?
No , because we shouldn't be doing that , stuff .
Oh well , God's in charge , and some people have to go to heaven , while other people have to go to hell .
That's true , lieutenant .
Speaking for myself , and no offense to the general or anyone else , I hope I'm going to heaven .
Me too , lieutenant .
Okay , but please not before me .
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
But let's stop this drinking and get down to business. , God forgive our sins ! , Gentlemen , let's get down to business .
By the way , I don't want anyone thinking I'm drunk .
I'm not drunk .
I can stand well enough , and I can speak just fine .
Yes , you're speaking very well .
Yes , very well .
So don't think that I'm drunk .
It's too bad .
But is he often like this ?
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
He'd stay up all night and all day if he didn't drink himself to sleep .
The general should be informed about this .
Don't you think so ?
And it's too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command .
We should definitely say something to the Moor .
Well .
Now I've done a good day's work .
You must all keep up this united front .
Don't simply hide your hatred .
Swear your love for each other .
On my honor , I swear I love Rivers with all my heart .
And I love Hastings with all my heart .
Take my hand , Hastings .
Dorset , embrace Hastings. , Hastings , express your affection for the marquess of Dorset .
I swear I will never break this promise of love .
And so do I , my lord .
Now , noble Buckingham , seal this alliance by embracing my wife's friends , and make me happy in your unity .
Noble Buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
And just in time , here he comes with Sir Richard Ratcliffe .
Good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
Happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
What blessed work , my king .
I hate it and want all good men's love .
Today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
If only all struggles ended this well .
Please pardon our brother Clarence .
Why , madam , have I offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
Who doesn't know that the good duke is dead ?
Who doesn't know he's dead ?
Who says he is ?
Oh my God , what a terrible world this is !
Do I look as pale as everyone else does , Lord Dorset ?
Is Clarence dead ?
But I reversed the death sentence .
Well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
Some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after Clarence was already buried .
It's clear that someone less noble , less loyal , more bloody-minded than Clarence but not a blood relation , deserves as bad an end as my brother , but he goes free .
Please be quiet .
My soul is full of sorrow .
I will not rise until your Highness hears me .
Then hurry up and tell me what you want .
That you lift the death sentence on my servant , who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of Norfolk .
We know you have a job to do , Brakenbury , and we'll do what you say .
Farewell , brother .
It doesn't make either of us happy , I know .
Well , your imprisonment won't last long .
I will either get you out , lying if I have to , or stay in prison in your place .
In the meantime , be patient .
I have no choice .
Goodbye .
Go walk the path that you will never return from .
I love you so much that I'll send your soul to heaven very soon , if heaven will accept anything from me , that is .
But who's coming ?
Good afternoon , my dear lord !
The same to you , my lord !
Welcome to the open air again .
How did you tolerate prison ?
But his punishment was bitter death .
Who pleaded with me to pardon
This is what happens when you act rashly .
Did you notice how the queen's guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about Clarence's death ?
Oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
God will revenge it .
But come , lords , will you come with me to Edward's room to comfort him ?
We'll come with you , your Grace .
Tell me , good grandmother , is our father dead ?
No , boy .
My pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
So you're admitting Clarence , my father , is dead .
My uncle the king is to blame for this .
God will take revenge .
And so will I .
Quiet , children , quiet .
The king loves you very much .
Innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who's responsible for your father's death .
You think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
Yes , boy .
I can't believe that .
What's that noise ?
I plan to fall into the blackest despair .
Why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
Why aren't the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
If you do intend to live , then mourn .
If you're going to die , be quick about it so you can catch the king's departing soul or follow him , like obedient subjects , to his new kingdom of endless night .
Since your woes are only a portion of mine , I have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own .
I could drown the world .
My poor husband , my dear Edward !
Our poor father , Clarence !
My sons Edward and Clarence !
What support did I have other than Edward ?
And now he's gone .
What support did we have besides our father ?
And now he's gone .
And now they're both gone .
There has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
There have never been orphans who've suffered what we have .
There was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
Alas , I am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
She weeps for Edward and so do I , while she does not weep for Clarence , though I do .
These young children cry for Clarence and so do I , though they don't cry for Edward , as I do .
Be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
Your peace of mind depends on him .
Sister , calm down .
All of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
On my knee , I humbly ask your blessing .
God bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
You mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief , now it's time to cheer each other up with love .
Though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
We must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
I think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from Wales and bring him to London to be crowned our king .
Why only a few courtiers , my lord of Buckingham ?
The king made peace among all of us .
And so do I. I think we all do .
So , I agree with noble Buckingham , only a few should go to meet the prince .
I think so too .
For God's sake , my lord , let's be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince .
Along the way , I'll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen's proud relatives , as step one in the plan we've discussed .
You are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
Good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
I'm telling you , I hardly know myself .
Did you hear the news that's going around ?
Yes , that the king is dead .
Neighbors , hello .
Good day to you , sir .
Is it true that good King Edward has died ?
Yes , sir , it's all too true , God help us .
Then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
No , no , with God's help , his son will be king .
It's bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
His counselors will govern as long as he's a minor , and then he'll take over .
With patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
It's a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .
What's the news abroad ?
Very sad .
Where is he , in his bed ?
He is .
You go ahead , and I will follow you .
That's how it was with Henry the Sixth , who was crowned in Paris when he was only nine months old .
Really ?
It would be better if they were all on his father's side , or that there were none at all on his father's side .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , is very dangerous , and the queen's sons and brothers are haughty and proud , it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects , not rulers .
Come , come , we're worrying about the worst-case scenario .
I'm sure everything will be fine .
When storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
So , if all turns out fine , as you say , it's more than we deserve or I expect .
It's always like this in times of change .
But leave it all to God .
Where are you all off to ?
The court has sent for us .
They'll be here tomorrow or the next day .
I'm dying to see the prince .
I hope he's grown a lot since I last saw him .
Yes , mother , but I wish I hadn't .
Why , dear child ?
It's good to grow .
Yes , " said my uncle Gloucester , "Small plants are graceful , while ugly weeds grow fast." And since then , I've wished I wouldn't grow so fast , because sweet flowers are slow while the weeds grow in a hurry .
Well , it certainly wasn't true for Richard !
As a child , he took such a long time to grow up that , according to his rule , he should have grown up into a gracious adult .
And no doubt he is , gracious madam .
I hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
Hey , if I'd remembered something about him , I could have had a good comeback for my uncle , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine .
What would you have said , my young York ?
Do tell .
Indeed , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old .
It took me two years before I had a single tooth .
Grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
Pretty York , who told you about his teeth ?
His nurse , grandmother .
His nurse ?
Why , she was dead before you were even born .
Well , if it wasn't her , I don't know .
A mischievous child .
Come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
Good lady , don't be angry with the child .
Little pitchers have big ears .
Here comes a messenger .
What's the news ?
My lord , it's news I wish I didn't have to report .
How's the prince ?
He's fine and healthy , madam .
What is your news ?
The powerful dukes Gloucester and Buckingham .
What did they do wrong ?
I've told you everything I know .
Why the nobles were imprisoned , and on what charges , I don't know , my gracious lord .
Oh no !
I see the downfall of my family .
Welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
My husband lost his life to get the crown , and my sons ' fortunes have been tossed up and down , leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses .
Let it end , or let me die so I won't have to watch any more of it .
The tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
It wasn't the journey itself , uncle , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull .
I want more uncles here to welcome me .
Those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
Your Grace heard their saccharine words , but didn't take note of their poisonous intentions .
God protect you from them and from other false friends !
God should keep me from false friends , but they weren't false .
My lord , the mayor of London is here to greet you .
God bless your Grace with health and happy days .
And what a slug Hastings is that he hasn't even arrived to tell us whether they're coming !
And , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
Welcome , my lord .
What , isn't my mother coming ?
God knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in Westminster Abbey .
Your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn't let him .
I wouldn't commit so serious a crime for anything .
In these less dainty times , you're not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
The prince has done neither ; therefore , in my opinion , he isn't really protected by sanctuary .
Often I have heard of "sanctuary men , " but until now I've never heard of "sanctuary children." My lord , you've won me over this time .
Lord Hastings , will you go with me ?
I'm coming , my lord .
Go as fast as you can .
Say , uncle Richard , if my brother comes , where will I stay till my coronation ?
Whatever seems best to you .
Of all places , I don't like the
He started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
Is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
On record , my gracious lord .
Well , I think that even if it weren't on record , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next , all the way to Doomsday .
What did you say , uncle ?
Death didn't conquer
The king won't live , I hope .
I'll marry the earl of Warwick's youngest daughter , Lady Anne .
So what if I killed her husband and her father ?
So that's what I'll do , not because I love her but because I'll get something out of it .
But I'm running ahead of myself .
Clarence is still alive ; Edward is not only alive , he's king .
Only when they're dead can I start to count my gains .
What , my dear lord ?
Richard of York , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
Very well , my supreme lord , that's what I have to call you now .
How's my nephew doing , noble lord of York ?
Thank you for asking , uncle .
Oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
The prince has far outgrown me .
He has , my lord .
Does that mean he's lazy ?
Oh , my handsome nephew , I must not say that .
In that case , he's more obliged to you than I am .
He may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
Uncle , please give me your dagger .
My dagger , little nephew ?
With all my heart .
Are you begging , brother ?
From my kind uncle , who I know will give it to me , especially as it's not worth much .
I'll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
A greater gift ?
That must mean a sword .
Yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
Oh , I see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
For more important things , you'll say no .
A sword's too heavy for you to wear .
I wouldn't think much of it even if it were heavier .
What's that ?
But , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
You mean , to bear me , not to bear My protector , Richard , insists on it .
I can't sleep quietly in the Tower .
Why , what are you afraid of ?
My uncle Clarence's angry ghost .
My grandmother told me he was murdered there .
I'm not afraid of dead uncles .
Nor living ones , I hope .
Well , I hope not .
No doubt , no doubt .
Oh , he's a dangerously clever boy , bold , quick-witted , capable .
He's his mother's child from head to toe .
Well , enough about them. , Come here , Catesby .
Hastings loved the prince's father so much that we won't be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince .
What about Stanley ?
Won't he join us ?
He'll do whatever Hastings does .
Okay , just do this , noble Catesby : sound out Lord Hastings , but make it seem as if you're just mulling over the idea , that it hasn't been firmed up yet .
If he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
But if he's resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
Give my regards to Hastings , Catesby .
My good lords , I plan to .
Will we hear from you before bedtime , Catesby ?
You will , my lord .
You'll find us both at Crosby Place .
Now , my lord , what are we going to do if we find that Lord Hastings won't go along with our plans ?
Chop off his head .
Whatever we decide to do .
And when I'm king , remember to ask me for the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it , which my brother the king used to own .
I look forward to that present .
You'll find I'll give it to you very willingly .
Come , let's have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
A messenger from Lord Stanley .
Four o'clock in the morning .
Can't Lord Stanley sleep ?
I guess not , for good reason , as you'll soon hear .
First , he sends his regards .
And then ?
Besides that , he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow , and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him , who are at the other , sorry .
While he and I are at one , my loyal servant Catesby will be at the other , so nothing will happen that we won't find out about .
Tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
And as for his dreams , I'm surprised he's so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night .
If we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us , we'll only make the boar angry and suspicious , causing him to chase us when he never intended to .
Good morning , my noble lord .
Good day , Catesby .
You're up early .
What news can you tell me in this fast-moving , unsteady state of ours ?
I believe it won't stop moving and stand upright till Richard wears the wreath of the realm .
What do you mean , "wears the wreath" ?
Are you talking about the crown ?
Yes , my good lord .
I'll have my head cut from my shoulders before I'll see the crown so misplaced .
But do you think that's what he's aiming for ?
For that reason he sends you this good news , that this very day your enemies , the queen's relatives , will die at Pomfret .
Well , I'm not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
Well , let's hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
But as for now , before two weeks have gone by , I'm going to send some people packing .
It's a horrible thing to die when you're not prepared for it , my gracious lord .
Yes , monstrous , monstrous !
That's how it will be for some other men , too , who think they're as safe as you and I , who are well-loved by noble Richard and Buckingham .
I know they do , and I certainly deserve it .
You're afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
My lord , good morning .
Good morning , Catesby .
My lord , my life is as important to me as yours is to you , and it was never as precious to me as it is now .
Do you think I would be feeling as triumphant as I am if I didn't know that our situation was secure ?
I hope to God I'm proven wrong !
Well , should we head to the Tower ?
The day is well on its way .
Set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
You know what , my lord ?
Those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
They deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
But come , my lord , let's go .
Go on ahead .
I'll talk with this good man .
What's up , man ?
How's it going ?
Better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
I tell you , man , it's better for me , too , than the last time we met here .
But now , I tell you , keep it to yourself , though , those enemies of mine are being put to death today , and I'm better than I've ever been .
Well , let's hope your good fortune continues !
Here , drink to me .
God be good to you !
A nice coincidence , my lord .
I'm glad to see you .
I thank you , Sir John , with all my heart .
I am indebted to you for your last sermon .
By next week , I'll be able to pay you .
Your friends at Pomfret , they're the ones who need a priest .
When I ran into this holy man , those men you mentioned did come to mind , in fact .
Are you headed to the Tower ?
I'll be off before you are .
Yes , probably , because I'm staying for lunch .
I'll follow you , my lord .
Hurry up .
Your lives are over .
Oh , Pomfret , Pomfret !
Oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
Now Margaret's curse has fallen on our heads , for standing by and doing nothing when Richard stabbed her son .
She cursed Hastings then .
Oh God , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
But don't kill my sister and her royal sons , be satisfied , dear God , with our blood , which is being spilled unjustly , as you know .
Hurry up .
The hour of death is approaching .
Come , Grey .
Come , Vaughan .
Let's embrace
In God's name , speak .
When should the royal day be ?
Is everything ready for that event ?
It is .
Tomorrow's a good day .
Who knows what the Lord Protector thinks ?
Who's closest to him ?
You , I think , would best know what he's thinking .
We know each other's faces , but as for our thoughts , he doesn't know any more about my thinking than I do about yours or his , or you do about mine .
Lord Hastings , you and he are close .
Thank you .
I know he holds me dear , but I haven't asked him about the coronation , and he hasn't told me .
But you , my noble lords , may name a time , and I'll second it on the duke's behalf , which I don't think he'll mind .
Right on cue , here's the duke himself .
My noble lords and relatives , good morning .
If you hadn't shown up on cue , my lord , Lord Hastings was going to take your part , I mean , he was going to speak for you , in the crowning of the king .
No one may be bolder than my Lord Hastings .
Buckingham , I need to have a word with you .
I'll come soon .
We have not yet set the coronation day .
Where is my lord , the duke of Gloucester ?
I have sent for the strawberries .
Richard is looking cheerful today .
You always know he's got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .
I don't think there's a man under the sun who's worse at hiding his love or hate than Richard .
I pray to God he isn't .
Then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
If they have done this thing , my noble lord , If ?
You lover of that damned whore , you're talking to me of "ifs" ?
You're a traitor. , Off with his head .
I pity England , but not myself .
Stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and I laughed and refused to flee with him .
Three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the Tower , as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse .
Oh , now I really need that priest who spoke to me today !
And I regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at Pomfret while I , as I said , was in good standing with Richard .
Oh Margaret , Margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor Hastings's miserable head !
Make your confession short .
He's eager to see your head .
We spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of God !
Anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast , ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea .
Come , come , hurry up .
It's pointless to talk now .
Oh bloody Richard !
Miserable England , I foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced. , Come , lead me to the block .
Bring him my head .
Those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
Frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
But has Catesby gone ?
A drum !
And if he ever has a wife , let her be more miserable when he dies than I am now .
What wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
Lord Mayor , the reason we have sent , Look behind you !
Defend yourself !
There are enemies here .
God defend and guard us innocents against them !
Stay calm .
They're friends , Ratcliffe and Lovell .
Here's the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected Hastings .
I loved this man so much it makes me weep .
He was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn't been for his love affair with Shore's wife , I would never have suspected him .
He would have ?
What , do you think we're Turks or savages , instead of Christians ?
I didn't expect any better from him once he got involved with Mistress Shore .
But , my good lord , the words of you and Lord Buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if I had seen and heard him speak myself .
That is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship , to avoid the public carping and complaints .
There was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
And , if you need to , approach the subject of me : tell them that when my mother became pregnant with the insatiable Edward , my noble father was fighting in France .
But only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother's still alive .
Goodbye , my lord .
If things go well , bring the crowd to I'm off .
Around three or four o'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
Lovell , go as fast as you can to Doctor Shaw .
Now I'll go inside and write out a secret order to keep Clarence's brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing King Edward's sons .
What a backward world we live in !
Why , who's so stupid that he can't see through this fraud ?
The world is a bad place , where you can't speak what you know .
It's incredible , they didn't say a word .
Did you mention that Edward's children are bastards ?
I did .
He said that the people weren't used to being spoken to except by the What blocks of wood !
They wouldn't say anything ?
Aren't the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
The mayor is here at hand .
And make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
But don't be easily won over .
I'm going now .
If you're as good at pleading to them as I am at saying no to you , this will definitely come to a happy end .
Hurry , go up to the roof .
The Lord Mayor is knocking .
Welcome , my lord .
I don't think he wants to be disturbed .
Now , Catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
My lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
Return to the gracious duke , good Catesby .
Tell him that the mayor , some citizens , and I have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good .
I'll tell him right away , my lord .
Ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like Edward !
He's not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body , but praying , to nourish his attentive soul .
England would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
But I'm afraid we'll never get him to agree to be king .
But God forbid he says no to us !
I'm afraid he will .
Here comes Catesby again .
What's up , Catesby , what does your master say ?
My lord , he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , since he had no idea they were coming .
My lord , he's afraid you mean him harm .
I'm sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
When devoutly religious men are praying , it's hard to draw them out of it , because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
See how he stands between two clergymen !
My lord , you don't need to apologize .
I beg you to pardon me .
I suspect that I have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better .
You have , my lord .
Sweet saint , for goodness's sake , don't be so angry .
If you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
It's your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
Oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
Either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him , as it does this good king's blood .
If I don't answer , perhaps you'll think I'm accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me .
First of all , even if all the obstacles were eliminated and my path led straight to the crown , if it were truly my birthright , I would rather hide from my greatness than hide inside the greatness of the position itself and be smothered by it .
So , thank God , there is no real need for me , as I wouldn't be able to help you much .
The royal tree has left us other fruit , which , with time , will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king , I'm sure .
God forbid that I snatch the crown from him .
King Edward was going to marry Lady Lucy , your mother can vouch for that , and then he was betrothed to Bona , the King of France's sister-in-law .
But both of these were put off by Elizabeth Grey , a careworn mother of many children who had once been a beauty but was now a stressed-out widow long past her prime .
Don't refuse the love we offer you .
Oh , make them joyful !
Grant their law-abiding request !
Alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
I am unfit to rule and to be king .
Please , don't take it badly , but I can not and will not give in to you .
But listen , if
Oh , please don't swear , my lord of Buckingham .
If you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
Would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
Well , call them back again .
I am not made of stone ; I am affected by all these kind pleas , though it goes against my conscience and my soul .
God bless your Grace !
We understand you're just doing it for us , and we'll be sure to say so .
If you say that , you'll only be telling the truth .
Then I salute you with this royal title : long live Richard , England's worthy king !
Amen .
Will you be crowned tomorrow ?
Whenever you want , since you're the one who wants it .
Who's this ?
My granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of Gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
Now , on my life , the young child must be headed to the Tower to greet the young princes , whom she adores .
Where are you going ?
Just to the Tower , I'm guessing , for the same reason you are : to salute the noble princes who are staying there .
Yes , kind sister .
We can all go together .
And here comes the warden , just in time .
They're just fine , my dear madam .
But I'm sorry , I'm not allowed to let you visit them .
The king has strictly forbidden it .
The king ?
Who's that ?
I meant to say the Lord Protector .
The Lord keep him from the title of king !
Richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
I am their mother .
Who's going to keep me from them ?
I am their father's mother .
I will see them .
I am their aunt , and I love them like a mother .
So take me to see them .
Officer , I'll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
No , madam , no .
I can't do this .
I am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
In just an hour from now , Duchess of York , I'll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens .
Oh , cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe , or I'll faint from this deadly news !
Cruel , cruel news !
Your mother's name has become a threat to her own children .
I'll write to my stepson Richmond on your behalf , so that he'll meet you on the way .
But don't delay .
O , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
It has hatched a I go unwillingly .
I wish to God that the golden crown that I'll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain !
If you want to make me happy , don't wish yourself harm .
No ?
Why ?
Every night I'm awakened by his Poor dear , goodbye .
I pity your situation .
No more than I do yours .
Goodbye .
You are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
Please treat my babies well .
Dear woman , you don't know the rules of charity .
Villain , you don't know the laws of God or of man .
Even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
If I know nothing about pity , that must mean I'm not an animal .
It's even stranger when an angel is so angry .
Divine , perfect woman , give me a chance to prove in detail that I'm innocent of the evils you accuse me of .
Contagious infection of humanity , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils I know you've committed .
You who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
You who are wicked beyond belief , the only "explanation" I'll accept from you is for you to hang yourself .
Such an expression of despair would only prove that I was guilty .
My gracious king .
Give me your hand .
Because of your advice and your help , I have a high position now .
But will I wear these honors for only a day or will I enjoy them for a long time ?
Let them last forever .
Oh Buckingham , now I'm going to test to see if you're truly made of gold .
Young Prince Edward is still alive , what do you think I'm going to say next ?
Go on , my loving lord .
Ha !
But Edward is still alive .
True , noble prince .
Oh , how bitter it is that Edward , the real "true , noble prince" , should still be alive !
Cousin , you didn't used to be so thickheaded .
Shall I put it plainly ?
What do you say ?
Your Grace can do whatever he wants .
Tut , tut , you've become rather icy .
Tell me , do I have your consent to kill them ?
Give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
I'll let you know my answer shortly .
My lord ?
Do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
What's his name ?
His name is Tyrrel , my lord .
I know the man a bit .
Go , bring him here , boy .
Look who's here !
What's the news with you ?
You should know , my loving lord , I've heard that the marquess Dorset has fled to Brittany , to the earl of Richmond .
Come here , Catesby .
Spread the rumor abroad that Anne , my wife , is very sick .
And find a poverty stricken gentleman who I can marry straightaway to Clarence's daughter .
Look at you , standing there in a stupor !
I repeat , spread the rumor that Anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
Are you Tyrrel ?
James Tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
Are you indeed ?
Do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
Well , that's what you get to do .
Two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
Tyrrel , I mean those bastards in the Tower .
Give me access to them , and soon you won't have to worry about them anymore .
That's music to my ears .
Come here , Tyrrel .
By this token , you'll be admitted to their cell .
Get up and listen to me .
That's all there is to it .
As soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and I will promote you .
I'll do it right away .
My lord , I have thought over the request you just made of me .
Well , it doesn't matter anymore .
Dorset has fled to the earl of Richmond .
I heard the news , my lord .
Stanley , Richmond is your wife's son .
Get information from her .
My lord , I'd want to have the gift you promised me on your honor : the earldom of Hereford and all the possessions that go with it .
Stanley , pay attention to your wife's doings .
If she sends any letters to Richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
What do you say , your Highness , about my just request ?
As I remember , Henry the Sixth prophesied that Richmond would be king when Richmond was only a foolish little boy .
A king , perhaps , My lord , How is it that the prophet didn't tell me at the time that I would kill him ?
My lord , your promise of the earldom , Richmond !
The last time I was in Exeter , the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it " My lord !
Yes , what time is it ?
I'm reminding your grace what you promised me .
Well , but what time is it ?
It's almost ten o'clock .
Well , let it strike ten then .
Why "let it strike" ?
Because you're like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell , you keep interrupting my thoughts .
I am not in the giving mood today .
You're bothering me .
I'm not in the mood .
Is this really happening ?
Does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
Did I work to make him king for this ?
Oh , let me remember what happened to Hastings and hurry to
It was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
Dighton and Forrest , whom I hired to perform the butchery , are used to killing people , the bloody dogs .
Their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
Kind Tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
If my doing what you told me to makes you happy , then be happy , because I did it .
But did you see them dead ?
I did , my lord .
And buried , noble Tyrrel ?
The Tower's chaplain has buried them , but to tell you the truth , I don't know where .
Tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
In the meantime , think about how I can do you good and give you what you want .
See you soon .
I humbly say goodbye .
Edward's sons have been carried off by the angels and Anne , my wife , has bid good night to the world .
Now I go , a jolly , thriving wooer , to marry my brother Edward's young daughter , Elizabeth , because I know Richmond has his eye on her .
My lord !
Is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
Bad news , my lord .
The Bishop of Ely has fled to Richmond , and Buckingham , backed by a hardy Welsh army , is on the march .
Ely joining Richmond troubles me more than Buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
Let's say I didn't kill them .
Then you might as well say they're not dead .
But they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
I did not kill your husband .
Well , then he must be alive .
You're lying .
Queen Margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
She provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes I didn't commit .
No , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
You killed this king , didn't you ?
Yes , I'll grant you that .
You'll grant me , you hedgehog ?
Then let God grant me that you'll be damned for that wicked deed .
Oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
That will please God , who has him now .
He is in heaven , where you will never go .
Let him thank me , who helped him get there .
I've lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
I'll head to France soon .
It's time to hide , wretched Margaret .
Who's coming ?
Ah , my poor princes !
If your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever , hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother's lament .
Hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
I've been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
Edward Plantagenet , why are you dead ?
Will you abandon such gentle lambs , God , and throw them to the wolves ?
Have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
Let my sorrow have the upper hand .
You had a Clarence , too , and Richard killed him .
Oh righteous God , how can I thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother's children and forces her to join others in their grief !
O Harry's wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
With God as my witness , I swear I have wept for yours .
Your son Edward , who stabbed my son Edward , is dead .
Your Clarence , who stabbed my Edward , is also dead .
Richard , a fiendish spy for hell itself , still lives , but only long enough to buy souls to send below .
I pray that God ends his life before I die , so I can say , "The dog is dead ! "
Oh , you prophesied that the time would come when I would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider , that hideous toad !
Back then , I called you "a poor , imitation queen , " a badly reproduced copy of what I was , a pretty prologue for the tragedy that was about to follow , a woman who was lifted high only to be hurled down to hell , a mother only teased with two beautiful children , who would soon die .
And I was right , because where's your husband now ?
Your brothers ?
Your two sons ?
Now you have only the memory of what you were , which tortures you when you consider what you've become .
You once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
Your English sorrows will make me smile in France .
You who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
Remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were , and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .
Making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
Think like this all day , and you'll learn how to curse .
My words are dull .
Enliven them with yours !
Your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
But give words a chance .
If that's true , then don't be tongue-tied .
Come with me , and let's smother my fiendish son , who smothered your two sweet sons , in bitter words .
Who's blocking the way ?
The woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you've committed by strangling you in her cursed womb .
Are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown , when , if there was any justice in this world , it should be branded with the murders you committed , your slaughter of the prince who held that crown , and of my sons and my brothers ?
Tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
Where are the noble Hastings , Rivers , Vaughan , Grey ?
Where is kind Hastings ?
Play , trumpets !
Don't let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the Lord's anointed king .
Play , I say !
Either be calm and polite or I'll drown you out with the music of war .
Are you my son ?
Yes , I thank God , my father , and yourself .
Then patiently listen to my impatience .
Madam , I'm a bit like you in that I can't tolerate a tone of disapproval .
Oh , let me speak !
Go ahead , but I won't listen .
I'll be gentle and mild .
And brief , good mother , I'm in a hurry .
Are you that impatient ?
God knows I waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when I gave birth to you .
And didn't I finally arrive to comfort you ?
So , what hour of comfort have I ever had in your company ?
Name one .
You're too bitter .
Just listen this once .
I'll never speak to you again .
So be it .
Though I have far more reason , I don't have as much energy to curse you .
But I say amen to everything she said .
Wait , madam .
I need to speak a word with you .
I have no more royal sons for you to murder .
You have a daughter named Elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
And does she have to die for this ?
Oh , let her live , and I'll ruin her manners and her beauty .
So that she may live , I'll say I cheated on Edward and that she is not really his child .
Don't wrong her birth .
She has royal blood .
To save her life , I'll say she doesn't .
Yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
Bad friends were .
My children would have enjoyed a better death if God had blessed you with a purer life .
Whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you're the one who gave the order .
No doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart , you reveled in my lambs ' bloody guts .
But constant expression of wild grief will only make it tame , so I'm not going to say any more about my boys until I've gouged your eyes out with my bare hands .
Madam , if I do as well as I think I'm going to do in these dangerous , violent wars , you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you've ever had bad !
What good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
The advancement of your children , noble lady .
Advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
No , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
And you're not suited for any place except hell .
Yes , and one other place , if you'll only let me name it .
Some dungeon .
Your bedroom .
There is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
Exactly , madam , until I sleep with you .
Well , explain , but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn't used up by talking about it .
Then know that from my soul I love your daughter .
I believe it .
What do you believe ?
That you love my daughter to spite your soul .
Don't be so quick to twist my meaning .
The one who makes her queen , of course .
Who else should it be ?
What , you ?
What do you think , madam ?
How would you woo her ?
And Madam , with all my heart .
Come , come , you're making fun of me .
This is not the way to win your daughter .
There isn't any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
But suppose I did all the things you named out of love for her .
Then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
Whatever has already been done can't be undone now .
Men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
If I took the kingdom from your sons , I'll give it to your daughter to make up for it .
If I have killed your children , I will have children with your daughter .
A grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
Your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
I can't make up for everything that I'd like to , so accept such kindness as I can offer .
Indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
Go , then , mother , to your daughter .
What should I say to her ?
That her father's brother wants to be her husband ?
Or should I say it's her uncle ?
Or should I describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
How can I describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with God , the law , my honor , and her feelings ?
Claim fair England's peace depends on this alliance .
She will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
Tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
He asks her to do what God Say she will be a high and mighty queen .
Only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
Say I will love her everlastingly .
But how long will "ever" last ?
Until her beautiful life's end .
But how long will her beautiful life last ?
As long as heaven and nature extend it .
As long as hell and Richard want it .
Tell her that I , her king , am her lowly subject .
But she , your subject , hates such a king .
Be eloquent on my behalf .
An honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
Then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
You can't tell a story simply when it's a lie .
Your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
Oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
Don't harp on that point , madam , it's past .
I will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
Now , by St. George , my knighthood , and my crown , The first you profaned , the second you dishonored , and the third you stole .
I swear , By nothing , because this is no oath .
St. George loses his holiness once Then , by myself , You've misused yourself .
Now , by the world , It's full of your ugly wrongdoings .
By my father's death , Your life has dishonored his death .
If you had been afraid to break an oath with him , the crown you are currently wearing would have graced the head of my child , and both princes would still be alive , not preyed on by worms .
What can you swear by now ?
By the future .
There are parents living whose children you have butchered ; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old .
Don't swear by the future , because you've ruined it before it has even arrived .
May I only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
Let me destroy myself , let heaven and destiny deprive me of happy hours , let day remain dark and night sleepless , and let me have nothing but terrible luck if I do not love with a pure heart , clean devotion , and holy thoughts your beautiful royal daughter .
My happiness and yours lie in her .
It
Shall I be tempted by the devil ?
Yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
Yes , if your memories do you no good .
Yet you killed my children .
But in your daughter's womb I will bury them .
Should I go convince my daughter to marry you ?
And be a happy mother by doing so .
I'm going .
Write to me very soon and I'll let you know what she thinks .
Many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren't willing to beat it back .
Word is that Richmond is the navy's admiral .
Someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of Here , my good lord .
Catesby , fly to the duke .
I will my lord , as fast as I can .
Ratcliffe , come here .
Ride to Salisbury .
Oh , right , good Catesby .
Tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at Salisbury .
I'm off .
What would you like me to do at Salisbury ?
Why , what is there to do before I get there ?
Your Highness just told me that I should ride there before you .
I changed my mind .
Stanley , what news do you have ?
Nothing that you want to hear , my lord , but nothing so bad that I can't mention it .
Well , how nice , a riddle !
Neither good nor bad .
Why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
Once again , what's the news ?
Richmond is sailing on the sea .
Let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
Lily-livered coward , what's he doing there ?
Well , what do you guess ?
That , stirred up by Dorset , Buckingham , and Morton , he's coming to England to claim the crown .
They are my daylight , my life .
Then I hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
Don't damn yourself .
I wish I were , so I could deprive you of both day and life .
There is no better one on earth .
Is the throne empty ?
Is the army without a leader ?
Is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
What heir of the York family is there alive other than myself ?
And who is England's king but an heir of the great York ?
Therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
Where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
Where are your tenants and your followers ?
Aren't they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships ?
Then they're cold friends to me .
What are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
They haven't been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
If your Majesty would like , I'll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .
Most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
I was never disloyal , and I never will be .
Then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , George Stanley .
My noble king , my friends have informed me that Sir Edward Courtney and his brother , the haughty Bishop of Exeter , are now in My king , the Guildfords in My lord , the duke of Buckingham's army , Enough , you
The news I have to tell your majesty is that Buckingham's army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall .
Buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
I beg your pardon .
Yes , your Highness .
Even if we don't fight foreign enemies , we'll beat down these rebels at home .
While we're talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
Someone deliver the order that Buckingham be brought to Salisbury .
Everyone else , march on with me .
But , tell me , where is the noble Richmond now ?
At Pembroke , or at Harfordwest in Wales .
Sir Walter Herbert , a renowned soldier ; Sir Gilbert Talbot ; Sir William Stanley ; Oxford ; the highly feared Pembroke ; Sir James Blunt ; Rice ap Thomas , with a valiant crew ; and many other famous and powerful noblemen .
Now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
I'm left with nothing to do in this weak , idle peacetime , unless I want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
Won't King Richard let me speak with him ?
No , my good lord .
So be calm .
Hastings and Edward's children , Rivers and Grey , holy King Henry and your fine son Edward , Vaughan , and all who have died from underhanded , corrupt , fiendish injustice , if your angry souls are witnessing this moment through the clouds , enjoy the revenge , laugh at my ruin !
This is It is , my lord .
Why , then , it's my body's doomsday .
Today I'm going to get what I said I wished would happen to me if I was ever false to King Edward's children or his wife's allies .
This is the day I'm going to get what I wished for when I wished that the person I most trusted would betray me .
This , this All-Souls ' day , is my just desserts .
I tried to play games with God , and he turned my fake prayer on my head , giving me for real what I'd asked for as a joke .
This is how God forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
I have done wrong , so I will suffer wrong .
I suspect his friends will join us .
He has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
In his greatest need , even they will desert him .
All to our advantage .
So , in God's name , let's march .
Hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
It turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
My heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
My Lord of Norfolk , Here , most gracious king .
Norfolk , we're going to have a few blows , right ?
We've got to give them and take them , my lord .
I'll lie here tonight .
But where will I lie tomorrow ?
Well , it doesn't matter .
Six or seven thousand , at most .
Why , our troops amount to three times that .
Besides , the king's name is a tower of strength ; the opposition doesn't have that advantage .
Let's be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
My Lord of Oxford , you , Sir William Brandon , and you , Sir Walter Herbert , are going to stay with me .
Good Captain Blunt , tell the earl goodnight from me , and tell him that by two in the morning I would like him to visit my tent .
Unless I've mistaken his battle flags , which I'm sure I haven't , his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king's mighty army .
If it's possible to do this without putting yourself in danger , dear Captain Blunt , say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note .
Upon my life , my lord , I'll do it .
There is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
Name him .
Plantagenet .
Yes , that's my husband's name .
Someone else has the same name , but he's a better man .
Where is this man ?
Here .
Why do you spit at me ?
If only I could spit poison .
Poison never came from such a sweet place .
Poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
Get out of my sight !
You're poisoning my eyes .
Your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
I wish my eyes were
Good night , dear Captain Blunt .
Come , gentlemen , let's discuss tomorrow's action in my tent .
The night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
What time is it ?
It's dinnertime , my lord .
It's nine o'clock .
I'm not going to eat dinner tonight .
Give me some ink and paper .
Is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
And has my armor been put in my tent ?
My good man Norfolk , hurry to your post .
I'm off , my lord .
Get up early tomorrow , at the sound of the lark , noble Norfolk .
I will , my lord .
Catesby .
Yes , my lord ?
Yes , my lord ?
Did you see the gloomy Lord Northumberland ?
Thomas , the earl of Surrey , and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .
Good , I'm satisfied .
Set it down .
Is my ink and paper ready ?
It is , my lord .
Ratcliffe , around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor .
Now leave me alone , as I said .
Let fortune and victory be yours !
I wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer , noble father-in-law .
Tell me , how is my mother ?
Your mother sends her blessings .
To be brief , as the occasion requires , prepare to fight early in the morning , when your future will be decided .
I can't do everything I want to , but I'll help you as well as I can .
But I can't be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother , young George .
Farewell .
The lack of time and the risk I'm under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other's news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long .
I hope we have the time some day !
Again , goodbye .
Be brave and do well !
Again , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
Oh God , whose side I think I'm fighting on , look kindly on my forces .
Make us your agents of revenge , so we can praise you when we're victorious !
Before I fall asleep , I entrust my soul to you .
Defend me , God , both when I'm asleep and when I'm awake .
I'm sweating and trembling with fear .
Myself ?
Yes , I am .
Then run away .
What , from myself ?
Why ?
Did I do anything good to myself ?
Oh , no .
I am a villain .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
Give me another horse !
Bandage my wounds !
Have mercy , Jesus ! , Wait , I was only dreaming .
Oh cowardly conscience , how you're torturing me !
But what am I afraid of ?
Myself ?
There's no one else here .
Richard loves Richard , that is , there's just me and myself here .
Is there a murderer here ?
No .
Yes , I am .
Then run away .
What , from myself ?
Unfortunately , I love myself .
Why ?
Did I do anything good to myself ?
Oh , no .
Alas , I hate myself instead , because of the hateful deeds I've committed .
I am a villain .
Fool , speak well of yourself .
Fool , do not flatter yourself .
My lord .
Damn it , who's there ?
Ratcliffe , my lord , it's me .
The rooster has already crowed twice .
Your friends are up and buckling on their armor .
Oh Ratcliffe , I had a terrifying dream !
What do you think , will my friends prove loyal ?
No doubt , my lord .
By St. Paul , ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless Richmond's soldiers could , dressed up in their most sword-proof armor .
It's not yet daylight .
Come with me ; I'll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me .
Good morning , Richmond .
Pardon me , lords and gentlemen who stayed awake .
How did you sleep , my lord ?
Since you left , I've been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams I've ever had , my lords .
I dreamed the souls of the people Richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .
I tell you , I feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream .
How late is it , lords ?
It's almost four .
Why , then , it's time to put on my armor and instruct the troops .
We have God and a good cause on our side .
The prayers of saints and those that Richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses .
Other than Richard , even those whom we fight against would rather we won .
Because who is this man they follow ?
If you struggle to bring down a tyrant , you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed .
When you fight against your country's enemies , you will be paid for your efforts with your country's wealth .
If you fight to protect your wives , your wives will welcome you home as conquerors .
When you free your children from the sword , your grandchildren will repay you in your old age .
So , in the name of God and all the good that will come of this
I wish they were , so that I could die right now , because , at this point , I live a living death .
I never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words .
If your vengeful heart can't forgive me , here , take my sword and bury it in my heart so that my soul , which adores you , can be free .
No , don't pause , because I
What did Northumberland say about Richmond ?
That he was never trained as a soldier .
That's true .
And what did Surrey say to that ?
He smiled and said , "The better for us." He's right , and that's how it is .
Read the time there .
Give me an almanac .
I didn't , my lord .
Ratcliffe !
My lord ?
The sun will not appear today .
The sky frowns and scowls on our army .
I wish there wasn't so much dew on the ground .
So , the sun won't shine today !
Get ready , my lord .
The enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield .
Hurry , hurry , prepare my horse .
John Duke of Norfolk and Thomas Earl of Surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers .
I'll follow in the center of the troop formation , which I'll defend with my best horse , and with Saint George on my side , as well !
What do you think , Norfolk ?
A good plan , warrior king .
I found this pinned to my tent this morning .
Listen !
I hear their drums .
Startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking .
What does Lord Stanley say ?
Will he bring his army ?
My lord , he refuses to come .
Off with his son George's head !
My lord , the enemy has already passed the marsh .
Let George Stanley die after the battle .
Let's go !
Victory is with us .
Help , my lord of Norfolk , help , help !
The king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible , challenging every enemy he sees .
His horse is killed , so he's fighting on foot , risking his life to search out Richmond .
Help , dear lord , or the battle will be lost !
A horse , a horse , I'd give my kingdom for a horse !
Get off the field , my lord .
I'll find you another horse .
God and your work be praised , victorious friends .
Great God of heaven , say amen to all this !
But , tell me , is young George Stanley alive ?
He is , my lord , and safe in Leicester , where , if you'd like , we can retreat to .
John Duke of Norfolk , Walter Lord Ferrers , Sir Robert Brakenbury , and Sir William Brandon .
As I vowed , I will unite the York and Lancaster families .
Smile , then , on this beautiful union .
What traitor hears me and doesn't say amen ?
Now let Richmond and Elizabeth , the true heirs of each royal house , be joined together !
Gracious Lord , blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor England apart again !
Let those who would mar this fair land's peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .
Civil wounds now can heal , and peace can live again .
So that England may live a long life like this , let God say amen !
Take up the sword again , or take me up .
Get up , liar .
Though I wish you were dead , I'm not going to be the one to kill you .
I have already .
You said it when you were furious .
Say it again , just one word , and my hand , which killed your lover out of love , will kill your far truer lover .
You will be an accessory to both crimes .
I wish I knew what was in your heart .
I've told you .
I fear that your words and your heart are both false .
Then no man has ever been honest .
Well , then , put your sword away .
Tell me that you'll accept my love .
You'll know about that later .
But can I have some hope ?
I'd like to think all men have some hope .
Please wear this ring .
Wear both the ring and my heart , because both are yours .
And if I , your poor devoted servant , may ask you for one small favor , you will guarantee my happiness forever .
What's that ?
Please leave it to me to take care of the burial , as I have more reason to mourn than you do .
For various reasons that must remain secret , please do this for me .
I'll do it with all my heart .
Say goodbye to me .
Sirs , take up the corpse .
Toward Chertsey , noble lord ?
No , to the Whitefriars monastery .
Wait for me there .
Has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind ?
And has anyone ever won her , as I've done ?
I'll get her , but I won't keep her long .
And yet , against all odds , I win her over !
Ha !
Has she already forgotten her brave husband , Prince Edward , whom I stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger ?
He was graced with lots of natural gifts , he was young , valiant , wise , and no doubt meant to be king .
And yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me , who cut her sweet prince's life short and made her a widow ?
On me , though I am barely half the man that Edward was ?
On me , though I am limping and deformed ?
I bet I've been wrong about myself all this time .
Even though I don't see it , this lady thinks I'm a marvelously good-looking man .
Time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions .
Since I'm suddenly all the rage , it will be worth the cost .
But first , I'll dump this fellow in his grave , then return to my love weeping with grief .
Come out , beautiful sun , until I've bought a mirror to admire my reflection in , I'll watch my shadow as I stroll along .
Be patient , madam .
I'm sure his majesty will recover his health soon .
Then you'll be able to cheer If he were dead , what would happen to me ?
But he's young , and as long as he's too young to become king , Richard , the duke of Gloucester , has power over him .
Richard loves neither me nor any of you .
Has it been decided that Richard will be It's been decided , though not yet officially announced .
I hope God makes you happy again , like you once were .
Did you see the king today , Lord Derby ?
Yes , the duke of Buckingham and I have just returned from visiting him .
What are the chances of his getting better , lords ?
Madam , keep up hope .
He seems cheerful .
God give him health .
Did you talk with him ?
Yes , madam .
I wish I could believe you that all was well !
They're out to get me , and I won't stand for it !
Which of you has been complaining to the king that I don't like them ?
Can't a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick , sneaky lowlifes ?
Which of us are you referring to ?
You , who are neither honest nor good .
When did I ever do you any harm ?
Or any of you ?
Damn you all !
The king , whom I hope God will protect better than you would like , can't get a minute's rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints .
Brother , you've made a mistake .
He I can't tell what's going on .
The world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost .
Come , come , I know what you're referring to , Richard .
You resent my friends ' rise in society , and my own .
Let's hope we never need your help for anything .
Meanwhile , we're the ones who need you .
My brother is imprisoned because of you , I am disgraced , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren't worth a dime have suddenly been promoted .
By the Lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life I used to enjoy , I promise you I never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of Clarence .
Since I can't amuse myself by being a lover , I've decided to become a villain .
I've set dangerous plans in motion , using lies , drunken prophecies , and stories about dreams to set my brother Clarence and the king against each other .
His majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the You're being arrested ?
Why ?
Because my name is George .
That's not your fault !
He should imprison the person who named you , instead .
Maybe the king is sending you to the Tower to have you renamed .
But , really , what's going on , Clarence ?
Can you tell me ?
She could even what ?
Certainly , your grandmother had a worse match .
My lord of Gloucester , I have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long .
By God , I will tell the king about these taunts .
I would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant I could escape your scorn and constant harassment .
I've had very little joy as England's queen .
If you were king , we would do the same .
If I were king ?
I'd rather be a peddler .
Hear me , you wrangling pirates .
Which of you does not tremble when you see me ?
Ugly , wrinkled witch , what are you doing here ?
Only describing what you have ruined .
Or at least that's what I plan to do before I let you go .
Weren't you banished on pain of death ?
I was .
The sorrow that I feel actually belongs to you , and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me .
Oh , killing that child was the dirtiest , most merciless deed there ever was !
Tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it .
Even What , were you all snarling before I arrived , ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs , but now that I'm here , you turn your hatred toward me ?
All because of what happened to that brat Rutland ?
Enough of your magic spells , you hateful , withered hag .
And leave you out ?
Don't move , dog .
It's your turn now .
Richard .
Yes ?
I didn't call you .
I beg your pardon , I thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names .
Yes , I was , but I don't want an answer from you .
Let me finish my curse .
I've finished it for you , and it ends in "Margaret." He's turned your curse against you , Margaret .
Poor imitation queen , why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he's got you trapped in his deadly web ?
The day will come when you'll wish I could help you cast spells against this poisonous , hunchbacked toad .
Woman , stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you .
Shame on you ; I've already run out of patience with you all .
If you got what you deserved , you would learn some respect .
What I deserve is that you treat me like a queen , and what you deserve is to act like my subjects .
Give me what I deserve , and do your duty !
People in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind , and when they fall , they shatter into pieces .
Good advice , indeed .
Take it to heart , Dorset .
It applies to you as much as to me , my lord .
But you turn that sun into a shadow .
You are building your nest in
Stop , if you can't be kind , at least have some shame .
How dare you talk about kindness or shame .
Enough , enough .
Your clothes aren't spattered with my family's blood , and you aren't affected by my curse .
No one here is affected by your curse , because curses are just words with no power .
What is she saying , my lord ?
Nothing that interests me , my good lord .
What , you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil I'm warning you about ?
Her curses have made my hair stand on end .
Mine , too .
I don't understand why she's not locked up .
I can't blame her .
I never caused her any harm , as far as I know .
But you have all the advantages from the harm done .
And look how he's repaid poor Clarence for his loyalty , penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter .
God pardon those who are responsible for Clarence's troubles .
I always pray for them
I'll tell you as soon as I know , Richard , because at this point I have no idea .
He picked out the letter "G" from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that "G" will take the throne away from his children .
He thinks "G" is me .
Well , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women .
The king isn't the one sending you to the Tower , Clarence .
It's his wife , Lady Grey , who got him to do this .
Madam , his majesty asks for you , and for you , Duke of Gloucester , and for you , my noble lords .
We will wait on you , your majesty .
I do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels .
Dressing my out-and-out wickedness in scraps of Scripture , I look like a saint exactly when I'm most like the devil .
But quiet .
Are you going to take care of this thing now ?
We are , my lord .
Good thinking .
I have it on me here .
Tut , tut , my lord , we're not going to stand around chit-chatting .
Talkers aren't good doers .
Rest assured that we're going there to use our hands , not our tongues .
When fools cry , you remain stony .
I like you guys .
Hurry now , get the job done .
We will , my noble lord .
Why do you look so depressed today , your Grace ?
What was your dream ?
Tell me .
I thought I had escaped from the Tower and was on a ship to France with my brother Richard , who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him .
Looking toward England , we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we'd had in the wars between the Yorks and the Lancasters .
Lord , how painful it was to drown .
I saw a thousand shipwrecks , a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone , huge anchors , chunks of gold , heaps of pearls , and precious jewels , all scattered on the bottom of the sea .
So you had time as you were dying to look around ?
It wouldn't let my soul find its way to air but smothered it inside my gasping body .
In fact , the real nightmare had only just begun .
With the help of the grim The first to greet me there was my great
Clarence has arrived , lying , cowardly I'm not surprised it scared you , my lord .
It scares me just to hear you talk about it .
I did them for Edward's sake , and look how he rewards me. , Oh God , if my prayers don't satisfy you , and you have to avenge the wrongs I've done , at least punish me alone !
Please spare my innocent wife and children ! , Kind warden , please stay with me for a while .
I'm feeling very low , and I need to sleep .
I'll stay , my lord .
May God bring you sleep !
Sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons .
The only glory princes have are their titles .
What do you want , fellow ?
And how did you get in here ?
I want to speak with Clarence , and I came here on my legs .
That's it ?
Well , sir , it's better to say little than to be tedious .
It orders me to hand the noble duke of Clarence over to you .
Here are the keys , and there is the duke , sleeping .
You may , sir .
That's a wise idea .
Goodbye .
What , should I stab him while he sleeps ?
No .
When he wakes up !
Why , he won't wake up till Judgment Day .
Okay , so that's when he'll say we stabbed him in his sleep .
That word "judgment" makes me feel a bit guilty .
What , are you afraid ?
Not of killing him , because I have a warrant for it , but of being damned for killing him , which no warrant can protect me from .
I thought you were resolved to do this .
I am resolved , to let him live .
I'll go back to the duke of Gloucester and tell him so .
Please , just wait a minute .
I'm hoping my holy mood will pass .
It usually only lasts about twenty seconds .
How are you feeling now ?
Actually , I'm still feeling some pangs of conscience .
Remember the reward we're getting when the deed's done .
Jesus , let's kill him !
I forgot about the reward .
Where's your conscience now ?
Oh , in the duke of Gloucester's wallet .
When he opens his wallet to give us our pay , your conscience will fly out ?
It won't matter .
Let it fly out .
No one will listen to it .
And what will you do if it returns to you ?
I won't bother with it .
It blushes , is easily embarrassed , and stages regular uprisings in a man's heart .
I'm strong-willed .
He won't get the better of me .
Spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation .
Shall we get to work ?
We'll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords , then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .
What an excellent idea , he'll soak up the wine !
Strike !
No , first let's talk to him .
Where are you , keeper ?
Give me a cup of wine .
You'll have wine enough , my lord , soon .
In God's name , who are you ?
A man , like you .
But not a member of the royal family , like me .
And you're not loyal , like us .
Your voice is loud and commanding , but you look like a working man .
I'm speaking for the king , but I look like myself .
Your eyes look threatening .
And why are you so pale ?
Who sent you here ?
Why are you here ?
To , to , to , To murder me ?
Yes .
You barely have the heart to tell me , so you can't possibly have the nerve to do it .
Besides , how have I offended you , my friends ?
You didn't offend us , you offended the king .
He and I will make up .
Never , my lord .
So prepare to die .
It's your job in life to kill the innocent ?
What did I do wrong ?
Where's the evidence against me ?
Where's the jury , the judge , the lawful proceedings , the verdict ?
Who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me ?
For you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful .
If you hope to have your sins forgiven by Christ's dear blood , which He shed for our terrible sins , you must leave and keep your hands off me .
What we do we have been commanded to do .
All right .
If you like , Brakenbury , you can listen to anything we say .
We're not saying anything treasonous , man .
We say the king is wise and good , and his noble queen is getting old , pretty , and not jealous .
What do you think ?
Is there anything inaccurate in that ?
I have nothing to do with what you're talking about , my lord .
Her husband , you rascal .
Are you going to get me in trouble ?
I beg your
And the one who commands us is our king .
He does , and now he's taking revenge on you , for breaking promises and for murder , too .
Whom you swore you would protect and defend .
How dare you tell us about God's laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself ?
But for whose sake did I do that sick deed ?
For my brother Edward's sake .
If God will be revenged for this deed , he will do it publicly .
God doesn't need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him .
My brother's love , the devil , and my own anger made me do it .
I am his brother , and I love him very much .
You're mistaken .
Richard , the duke of Gloucester , hates you .
No , he loves and cherishes me .
Go to him from me .
We will .
Tell him that when our noble father , the duke of York , gave his three sons his blessing , he never imagined that our friendship would come to this .
Remind Richard of this , and he will weep .
Yes , he'll weep stones , as he taught us to do .
Yes , as kind as snow to a harvest .
Come on , you're fooling yourself .
It's Richard who sent us here to slaughter you .
Well , that's what he's doing , making you free to enjoy heaven .
Make peace with God , for you must die , my lord .
You have enough holy feeling to advise me to "make peace with God , " but you're willing to go to war with God by murdering me ?
Oh sirs , consider this : those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it .
Relent , and save your souls .
If either of you were a prince's son , and you were imprisoned as I am now , and two murderers like yourselves came to you , wouldn't you beg for your life ?
Yes , you would beg , if you were in my position .
Relent ?
No .
That's cowardly and womanish .
Look behind you , my lord .
Take that , and that .
A What's going on ?
What did you mean by not helping me ?
By God , I'm going to tell the duke how slack you've been .
I wish you could tell him I saved his brother .
I'm not .
Go , coward that you are .
Well , I'll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial .
And when I get my reward , I'll get out of here .
Here comes your father .
Don't even think about refusing .
I must and will have Katherine for my wife .
Now , Signior Petruchio , how are you getting on with my daughter ?
Beautifully , sir , beautifully !
Now , daughter Katherine ?
Are you down in the dumps ?
You have the nerve to call me daughter ?
Sir , this is the truth : you and the rest , all the people who have ever talked about her , have all been wrong .
She has the patience of a I'll see you hanged on Sunday first !
Listen to that Petruchio : she says she'll see you hanged first .
Is this your idea of success ?
So much for our plan .
Relax , gentlemen .
I've made my choice .
If she and I are happy , what's it to you ?
When we were alone , we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant .
I tell you , though , it's incredible how much she loves me .
Darling Kate !
You men are rank beginners !
Give me your hand , Kate .
I'm off to Venice to buy outfits for the wedding .
God give you joy , Petruchio .
Call it a match !
Amen to that !
We'll be your witnesses .
Father , wife , friends , farewell !
I'm off to Venice .
Sunday is just around the corner .
We're to be married on Sunday .
Was there ever a match put together so quickly ?
I've made a risky investment .
The only profit I seek is a peaceful match .
There's no doubt that Petruchio's got quite a catch .
Now , Baptista , let's turn to your younger daughter .
We've been waiting a long time for this day .
I'm your neighbor and came courting first .
Callow youth , you don't yet know how to love !
And you're all sizzle .
Stand back , boy .
Age is the thing that nourishes .
Enough , gentlemen .
I will settle this matter .
First of all , my house in the city , as you know , is filled with expensive furniture and household articles , china and gold , basins and pitchers for her to wash her dainty hands in .
Then , at my farm I have a hundred milk cows , a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables , and all the equipment necessary to maintain them .
Two thousand ducats a year from his land !
I can't offer her more than all I have .
I must admit your offer is the best .
Otherwise , forgive me , but if you should die before him , what becomes of her dowry ?
Oh , and young men never die ?
As you know , next Sunday my daughter Katherina is to be married .
I believe your Honor is thinking of a character called Soto .
Yes , that was it .
You gave an excellent performance .
There is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight .
Go , lad , and take them to the pantry .
Farewell , good neighbor .
Your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house .
It's absurd .
An old Italian fox is never that generous , my boy .
Sneaky , dried-up old coot !
Usually fathers produce children , not the other way around .
But in this case of wooing , a child shall father his own father , if my wits don't fail me .
I'll have my lessons in the order and manner
Where did we leave off ?
Here , madam : Translate .
Now let me see if I can translate it .
There's no need to be , really , for , You're my teacher , so I must believe you .
But let it go. , Now , Litio , it's your turn .
I hope , sir , that you're not angry that I've been equally attentive to you both !
You call this a scale ?
I don't like it .
I like doing things the old-fashioned way .
Mistress , your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister's room .
You know tomorrow is her wedding day .
Farewell to both of you , dear teachers .
I have to go .
But there's reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster .
He acts like a man in love .
The humiliation is all mine .
So now everyone will point at me and say , "Look , there goes the wife of that comedian Petruchio , if he could be bothered to marry the pathetic thing ! "
Maybe , but I wish I'd never laid eyes on him .
Go , daughter .
I can not blame you now for weeping .
Master , master !
I have news , old news such as you never heard before !
You say you have news that's old ?
How can that be ?
Well , is it not news that Petruchio's coming ?
Is he here ?
Why , no , sir .
What then ?
He is coming .
When will he be here ?
When he stands where I am and sees you there .
Who comes with him ?
He's dressed like a freak , a total freak , and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman's valet .
I am glad he's coming , however he's dressed .
Why , sir , he's not coming .
Didn't you just say he was ?
Who ?
Petruchio ?
Yes , Petruchio .
No , I said his horse is coming , with him on its back .
Well , that's the same thing .
No , by Saint Jamy , I'll bet you a penny !
You are welcome , sir .
I'll give you more instructions later .
I know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman , taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures .
I can't wait to hear him call the drunkard "husband , " and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
I'll go and coach them .
Where is my lovely bride ?
Why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
It's a long story , and tough to listen to .
But where is Kate ?
We're wasting time here .
Don't greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes .
Go to my room and put on something of mine .
Not me .
I'll see her like this .
But surely you're not planning to
Yes , just like this .
Though I expect she'll wear me out more quickly than I'll wear out what I'm wearing , which will be good for her and even better for me !
But what a fool I am to stand here chatting when I should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss .
He must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason .
I'll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church , if it's at all possible .
I'll go too and make sure that happens .
And
We'll outwit them all , that old geezer , Gremio ; the suspicious father , Minola ; the prim musician lover , Litio , all for the sake of my master , Lucentio .
Signior Gremio , are you coming from the church ?
As eagerly as I ever came from school .
Bridegroom ?
No , he's a devil , a devil , I tell you !
Why , she's a lamb , a dove , a child compared to him !
She trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him .
Finally , the ceremony done , he called for wine .
Next he slung his arm around the bride's neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo .
That was the limit for me .
It's disgraceful !
There go the minstrels .
You're not thinking of leaving tonight , surely ?
Not tonight , today .
If you knew the reason , you'd understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .
Good friends , I thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient , sweet , virtuous wife .
Goodbye to you all .
Can't do it .
As a favor to Nope .
As a favor to I'm delighted .
Delighted to stay ?
Delighted to hear you ask so nicely , but I won't stay in any case .
Look , if you love me , stay .
Grumio , get me my horse .
Yes , sir , they're ready .
They've eaten themselves sick .
The door is open , sir .
Go on , wear your boots out !
As for me , I'll leave when I like .
Calm down , Kate .
Please don't be angry .
I will be angry .
What business is it of yours ? , Father , be quiet .
He'll stay as long as I say .
Okay , now it starts !
Gentlemen , on to the bridal dinner .
I see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn't have nerve enough to stand up for herself .
They
No , let them go .
They're certainly a peaceful couple !
That since she's mad herself , she's married a madman .
Neighbors and friends , though we don't have anyone for the bride and bridegroom's places at the table , you know there's nothing missing in the feast itself .
She shall , Lucentio .
Come , gentlemen , let's go in .
To hell with all worn-out horses , all crazy masters , and all bad roads .
Was a man ever beaten as much as me ?
Was a man ever as dirty as me ?
Was a man ever so tired ?
I have been sent on ahead to light a fire , and they are coming after to warm themselves .
It's a good thing I'm like a little pot and warm up quickly , or else my lips themselves would freeze and stick to my teeth , my tongue to the roof of my mouth , and my heart would freeze in my belly , before I managed to get thawed out .
I'll warm myself by blowing on the fire .
Who calls so coldly ?
A piece of ice .
Trust me , you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck .
Start the fire , good Curtis .
Are my master and his wife coming , Grumio ?
Yes , yes , Curtis , so hurry up and start the fire .
Leave out the water .
Is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?
Well she was , good Curtis , before this frost .
Your horn is a foot long , and I'm at least that size .
So tell me , Grumio , how goes the world ?
Therefore , do your duty and take your reward , because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death .
The fire is ready .
So go on , tell me the news .
I think I'm getting delirious .
Where's the cook ?
Is supper ready ?
Are all the cups and glasses in their places , the tablecloths laid out , everything in order ?
For God's sake , would someone bring me a mug of beer !
Would your Honor like to try this dried fruit ?
What garment would your Honor like to wear today ?
I'm Christopher Sly .
Everything's ready .
So tell me what's been going on .
Well , first of all , my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out .
How ?
From their saddles into the dirt , but that's another story .
Well , let's have it , Grumio .
Lean forward .
Here .
There !
This is to feel the news , not hear it .
That's what makes it "sensitive" news .
I was just knocking to see if anyone was home .
Now , I'll begin : first , we came down a steep hill , my master riding behind my mistress , Both on one horse ?
What's the difference ?
Well , the difference of a horse !
It's too bad .
Yes , as you and the rest will find out as soon as he's home .
But why am I telling you this ?
Get them in here , Nathaniel , Joseph , Nicholas , Philip , Walter , Sugarsop , and the rest .
Tell them to slick down their hair , brush their blue coats , and make sure their socks match .
Have them click their heels together and don't dare touch a hair of the master's horse's tail till they kiss their hands .
Are they all ready ?
They are .
Get them in here .
She already has a face .
Yeah , so ?
You just said they had to face her .
I meant they had to give her credit .
She's not going to borrow money from them .
Welcome home , Grumio .
What's up , Grumio ?
Hey , Grumio !
My man Grumio !
So what's the story , old boy ?
Any minute .
Where are those bastards ?
Here , here , sir !
Here , sir !
Here , sir !
Here , sir !
Here , sir !
Here , sir ! " You stupid , unpolished dolts !
Where is the fool I sent on ahead ?
Here , sir , as foolish as ever .
You unwashed farmworker !
You bastard workhorse drudge !
Didn't I tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you ?
Nathaniel's coat was being fixed , sir .
And Walter couldn't get his dagger out of its sheath .
Only Adam , Rafe , and Gregory were ready .
Go , blockheads , go , and bring my supper to me .
Where are my slippers ?
Can we have some water please here ? , Come and wash , Kate , make yourself at home .
Take it easy !
Please !
It was just an accident !
Will you say grace , sweet Kate , or shall I ? , What is this ?
Mutton ?
Yes .
Who brought it out here ?
I did .
You bastards !
Where is that moron of a cook ?
How dare you serve it to me this way !
There , take it all back , plates , cups , the whole thing .
Please , dear , calm down .
The meat was fine if you wanted to eat it .
And I'm telling you it was burnt and dried out .
Come , I'll show you your bridal chamber .
Peter , did you ever see anything like it ?
He's giving her a taste of her own medicine .
Where is he ?
Look out , he's coming !
Well , I've begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan , and I have every hope of succeeding .
My falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me , for if her hunger is satisfied , she'll pay no attention to the bait .
I have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner's call is to keep her from sleeping ,
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
She had no food today and will have none .
Last night she got no sleep , and she won't get any tonight .
Just as I did with the meat , I'll make up some problem with the way the bed is made , and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other , and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .
And if she starts to drop off , I'll rant and yell until I wake her up .
If anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew , speak up , please .
It would be much appreciated .
What are you reading , teacher ?
Answer me that first .
I hope you're an expert in your field .
Let me come clean .
I'm not really Litio .
My name is Hortensio , sir .
Look how they kiss and carry on !
The hell with her !
Look how she carries on with him !
It's revolting !
Well , to be on the safe side , so I don't go back on my promise , I plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days .
Farewell , then , Signior Lucentio .
From now on , goodness in women , not superficial beauty , will win my heart .
What , are you trying to make me crazy ?
I'm Christopher Sly , son of old Sly of Barton-on-Heath , a peddler by birth , a Oh , this is why your poor wife is mourning !
And this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow !
Oh noble lord , consider your lineage .
Look how your servants wait on you , each one ready to do whatever you command .
Would you care to hear some music ?
Listen !
Do you want to sleep ?
We'll have a couch made up that's softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
You're busted .
Hortensio and I have given you up .
You can't mean it , Tranio !
Have you both really given me up ?
Yes , ma'am , we have .
So Litio's out of the picture .
He's going after a young widow .
Well , good for him !
Yeah , and he's going to tame her .
Is that what he says ?
The taming school ?
Is there such a place ?
Master , master , I've been on the lookout so long , I'm ready to fall down dead , but I've got one , finally !
What does he look like , Biondello ?
And what about him , Tranio ?
Go , take your sweetheart and leave him to me .
May God keep you well , sir .
This is it , for now .
Mantua .
Killed ?
Why ?
That would be a little extreme !
It's a capital offense for anyone from Mantua to come to Padua .
Didn't you know ?
It's strange that you haven't heard .
I have promissory notes from Florence that I have to deliver .
Oh yes , sir , I have often been to Pisa , Pisa , City of Wise Men .
Oh sir , I accept .
And I'll be eternally grateful to you .
No , no , I can't , really .
The more I suffer , the more spiteful he becomes .
Did he marry me just to starve me ?
And if they don't find charity there , they find it someplace else .
But I , who have never known how to beg and never had to beg , am starved for food , dizzy with lack of sleep , kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .
And what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love , as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .
What do you say to a calf's foot ?
Oh , lovely .
Can I have some ?
I'm afraid it will I'd love it .
Nice Grumio , bring me some .
I don't know .
I'm afraid it will make you too hot , too .
What do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?
Yes , but the mustard is probably too hot .
Well then , the beef without the mustard .
Absolutely not .
You'll take the mustard or you'll get no beef from Grumio .
Then both , or one , or anything you like .
How about the mustard without the beef .
Get out of here , you measly , lying wretch .
Cheer up .
Give us a smile .
Look , love , see how devoted I am ?
I am sure , sweet Kate , this kindness deserves thanks .
What , not a word ?
I guess you don't want it .
Here , take away the dish .
Please , leave it here .
Thank you , sir .
Come , mistress Kate , I'll join you .
Now , tailor , let's see what you've got .
Lay out the gown .
What can I do for you , sir ?
Here is the cap your Worship ordered .
Why , this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
No , definitely not !
It's cheap and nasty !
It's like a cockleshell or a walnut shell , a joke , a prank , a doll's cap .
Take it away .
Bring me a bigger one .
I won't have one any bigger .
When you are gentle , you shall have one , too , and not till then .
Sir , I think I have the right to speak , and speak I certainly will .
I am not a child or an infant .
Better men than you have heard me speak my mind , and if you can't take it , then you'd better plug your ears .
You know , you're right .
It's a measly little cap , a dessert crust , a plaything , a silk pie .
I love you all the more for not liking it .
I don't care if you love me or not , I like the cap and I'll have it or I won't have any .
Now , your gown ?
Yes , yes .
Come , tailor , show it to us .
Merciful God !
What do you call this ?
A sleeve ?
It's like a cannon .
Carved it up and down like an apple tart ?
Snip and snip and cut and slash , it's got more holes than a sieve !
What in the world do you call this , tailor !
You told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style .
Certainly , I did .
But if you remember , I didn't tell you to parody the style .
I won't take it .
Do whatever you want with it .
I never saw a better-designed gown , more elegant and pleasing and well made .
Yes , that's it !
It's a lie , you thread , you thimble , you measurement !
You flea , you louse , you winter cricket !
Disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !
I tell you , you've ruined her gown .
It's not true .
The gown was made just as my master was directed .
Grumio gave the order for how it should be done .
I gave him no order .
I gave him the material .
But how did you want it made ?
With a needle and thread .
But didn't you expect us to cut the cloth ?
Well , don't face off with me .
You have bested many things , well don't try and best me .
I will not be faced or bested .
I tell you I requested that your master cut out the gown , but I didn't ask him to cut it all to pieces .
Why , here is the order to prove it .
Read it .
The note is a big fat liar if it says I said so .
Do you like pictures ?
You have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age .
Before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world , and even now she has no equal .
I admit the cape .
I admit two sleeves .
Ah , there's the problem .
Error in the bill , sir , error in the bill !
I ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again , and I'll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble .
I am ready for you .
You take the bill and I'll take your yardstick .
God have mercy , Grumio !
He won't have a chance .
Well , sir , the gown is not for me .
You are right , it's for my mistress .
Go , take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can .
Certainly not !
Take off my mistress ' gown for your master's use !
Why , what's the problem ?
Oh , sir , the problem goes far deeper than you realize .
Take up my mistress ' gown for his master's use !
Oh , that's disgusting !
Ah well , my Kate .
I mean , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful ?
Is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
Hardly , Kate .
If you regard it as shameful , put the shame on me .
We're off to eat and whoop it up at your father's house .
I hate to say it , but it's almost two and we won't get there before suppertime .
It shall be seven o'clock before I get on my horse .
Whatever I say , or think , or do , you're continually contradicting it .
Sirs , never mind .
We won't go today , or any day until it's clear that it shall be whatever time I say it is .
Yes , certainly .
Unless I am mistaken , Signior Baptista may remember me from the Pegasus in Genoa , where we both stayed twenty years ago .
Of course I will .
But , sir , here comes your servant .
Don't worry about me .
I told him that your father was in Venice , and that you expected him to arrive in Padua today .
He gives BIONDELLO Here comes Baptista .
Places , everyone !
Signior Baptista , I'm glad to see you. , Sir , this is the gentleman I told you of .
I hope you'll be a good father to me now .
Give me Bianca for my inheritance .
Sir , pardon me for what I am about to say .
I appreciate your frankness and your brevity .
It's true that your son Lucentio here loves my daughter , and she loves him , or else they're putting on quite an act .
Your son will have my consent to marry my daughter .
Not in my house , Lucentio .
My servants might overhear , and old Gremio is still hanging around , so we might be interrupted .
I hope with all my heart she will !
Cambio .
What is it , Biondello ?
You saw my master wink and laugh at you ?
What about it ?
Please , educate me .
He's talking with the bogus father about the bogus son .
And so , ?
You are to bring his daughter to the supper .
And then ?
The old priest at Saint Luke's Church is at your command at all hours .
And what of all this ?
I don't know , except they are busy with some phony guarantee .
So go and put your stamp on the girl .
Go to the church : take the priest , the clerk , and some reasonably honest witnesses .
If this isn't what you've been hoping for , I have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to Bianca forever .
I knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .
Farewell , sir .
My master has instructed me to go to Saint Luke's to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half .
She will be pleased .
Then why am I worried ?
It will be hard if "Cambio" loses her .
Come , let's continue on toward your father's house .
Good Lord , how bright and splendid is the moon tonight !
The moon ?
You mean the sun !
It is not nighttime now .
I say it's the moon that shines so bright .
I know it's the sun that shines so bright .
Now , by my mother's son , and that's me , it will be moon or star or whatever I want before I'll travel to your father's house .
I say it's the moon .
I know it's the moon .
Well , you're a liar , then .
It's the blessed sun .
Then God be praised , it Petruchio , do whatever you like .
You've won .
Well , onward , then .
That's how things should be , straight and smooth .
But , hang on !
I hear someone coming .
Young budding virgin , fair and pure and sweet , where are you off to ?
Your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child .
Is Would your Mightiness care to wash his hands ?
We're overjoyed to see you sane again .
If only you had a clearer memory of who you are !
These past fifteen years you have been living in a dream , and even when you were awake , it was as though you slept .
Fifteen years !
That's some nap .
But I never spoke the whole time ?
Oh yes , you spoke , my lord , but total nonsense .
But sir , there is no such house , no such maid , and no such men as you have dreamed up , like a certain Stephen Sly and one old John Naps of Greece , a Peter Turph , one "Henry Pimpernell , " and twenty more men of this sort , who never actually existed .
Why , dear me , Kate !
I hope you haven't lost your mind .
This is not a maiden , as you say , but an old man , wrinkled , faded , and withered .
Well , sir , and you , witty lady , who gave me quite a turn with your strange talk , my name is Vincentio , my hometown Pisa , and I am traveling to Padua to visit a son of mine whom I haven't seen in a long while .
What is his name ?
Lucentio , sir .
A fortunate coincidence , more fortunate for your son .
The sister of my wife , this lady here , is married to your son .
And there's no need for wonder or worry .
Let me embrace the father of Lucentio , and then we'll journey on to see your son , who will rejoice at your arrival .
I assure you , sir , it's true .
Well , Petruchio , all this is very encouraging .
The priest is already there .
We're off , Biondello .
I'll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master's .
I wonder why Cambio hasn't shown up in all this time .
Here is the door , sir .
This is Lucentio's house .
My father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace .
That's where I'm going now , so I'll leave you here .
You must not go without having a drink first .
They're pretty busy in there .
You'd better knock louder .
Is Signior Lucentio at home , sir ?
What if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around ?
I believe I have some choice in the matter , sir .
Come here , you wretch !
What , have you forgotten me ?
Forgotten you !
No , sir .
I could not forget you , since I never saw you before in my life .
My honorable , reverend master ?
Yes , of course .
There he is at the window .
Is that so ?
Help , help , help !
This madman will murder me .
How dare I ?
How dare What , is the man crazy ?
Your father !
Why , you scoundrel !
Your father is a sailmaker in Bergamo .
You're wrong , sir , very wrong .
Why , what do you imagine his name to be ?
His name !
Lucentio !
Oh God , he's murdered his master !
Oh , my son , my son !
Tell me , you monster , where is my son Lucentio ?
Take this mad wretch to jail. , Father-in-law Baptista , will you see that he's available to appear in court ?
Take me off to jail ?
He mustn't go to prison .
Be quiet , Signior Gremio .
I say he shall go to prison .
Be careful , Signior Baptista , lest you be made the dupe in this business .
I could swear this is the real Vincentio .
Well , no , not literally .
No , I know that you're Signior Lucentio .
Away with the doddering fool !
Take him off to jail !
We're ruined !
There he is !
Pardon , dear father .
Dear son , you're alive !
Pardon us , dear father .
What have you done ?
Where is Lucentio ?
I have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .
We've all been duped .
Where is that damned wretch , Tranio , who defied me in such a disgraceful manner ?
Say , isn't this the Latin master Cambio ?
Cambio is transformed into Lucentio .
It was love that performed these miracles .
Bianca's love made me trade places with Tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .
What Tranio did , he did at my command .
So pardon him , dear father , for my sake .
No , I'll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail .
But sir , have you married my daughter without my consent ?
Don't worry , Baptista , you'll be perfectly satisfied .
You'll see .
All I can hope for now is a share of the feast .
Let's follow them to see how this turns out .
First kiss me , Kate , and then we will .
What , here in the middle of the street ?
Are you ashamed of me ?
But I'm ashamed to kiss , sir .
All right then , back home we go .
No , wait .
I Isn't this good ?
Come , my sweet Kate .
Better late than never , and it's never too late to change .
Well , thank God I'm cured !
Amen .
I thank you all .
You won't regret this .
How is my noble lord ?
This is all quite pleasant .
Where is my wife ?
Here , noble lord .
What is your wish with regard to her ?
You call yourself my wife , yet you don't call me "husband" ?
It's my men who should call me "lord." I'm your man , your fellow .
My fair Bianca , bid my father welcome , while I with equal affection welcome yours .
This last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
Now everyone be seated , as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat .
All we do is sit and sit and eat and eat .
I wish that were true for both our sakes !
Hortensio
That's very sensible , but you missed my sense : I meant Hortensio is afraid of you .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning .
A very candid reply .
What's that supposed to mean ?
That's what I conceive of him .
Nice save !
Kiss him for that , good widow .
He who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning" , please , tell me what you meant by that .
Your husband , being saddled with a shrew , projects his own suffering onto my husband .
And now you know my meaning .
A very nasty meaning .
My meaning And I
You tell her , widow !
I'll bet you a hundred marks , my Kate puts her flat on her back .
Well , that's really my job .
Well said !
Here's to you !
What do you think of these quick-witted folks , Gremio ?
They certainly do like to butt heads !
Yes , but not out of fear .
I'll go back to sleep now .
No , you shall not .
I'll
Well , she got away .
Signior Tranio , you also took aim at that bird , though you didn't hit her. , So here's a health to all who've shot and missed .
A witty if a cynical reply .
It's good you hunted for yourself , sir .
Tranio got you that time .
I thank you for that quip , good Tranio .
He's made me a little sore , I'll admit .
But since the gibe glanced off me , ten to one it hit you both straight on .
Seriously , though , son Petruchio , I think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all .
Well , I disagree .
Agreed .
What's the bet ?
Twenty crowns .
Twenty crowns ?
I'd wager twenty times as much on my wife .
A hundred then .
Agreed .
Good !
It's a bet .
Who should begin ?
I will .
Biondello , go and tell your mistress to come to me .
Here I go .
Son , I'll stake you half that Bianca comes .
I'll have no halves .
What !
She's busy and can not come ! " Is that an answer ?
Yes , and a nice one at that .
Pray God your wife doesn't send you a worse one .
I'm hoping for better .
So , where's my wife ?
She says she thinks this is a prank .
She will not come .
She says that you should come to her .
Worse and worse !
She I can guess her answer .
What ?
She will not .
By all that's holy , here comes Katherina !
You sent for me , sir ?
Where are your sister and Hortensio's wife ?
They sit chatting by the parlor fire .
Go bring them here .
If they refuse to come , get physical , use a whip if you have to , but get them out here to their husbands .
This is a miracle , if you talk of miracles .
It is .
I wonder what it means .
It means peace and love and a quiet life , supremacy based on reverence and profound respect , and , not to go on and on about it , everything that's sweet and happy .
May good fortune come to you , good Petruchio !
You've won the wager , and I will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you .
Look , here she comes , with your ungovernable wives in tow , like prisoners of her womanly persuasion. , Katherine , that cap of yours doesn't look good on you .
Take it off and throw it on the ground .
Lord , may I never see a day of trouble until the day I let someone treat me like that .
For shame !
What kind of loyalty is this ?
I wish your loyalty were as foolish .
The wisdom of your loyalty , fair Bianca , has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner .
The more fool you for betting on my loyalty .
There will be no lecture .
She shall not .
I say she shall. , And first begin with her .
Girls , girls !
This disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord , your king , your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land .
A woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king .
And when she is peevish and perverse , sullen , sour , and disobedient to his honest wishes , what is she but a loathsome , warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord ?
I am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace , that they seek authority , supremacy , and power when they are under an obligation to serve , love , and obey .
Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unfit for toil and trouble in the world , if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?
Come , come , you weak , ungovernable worms !
My spirit has been as proud as each of yours , my courage as great , and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .
But now I see our weapons are like straws , our strength like a straw's weakness , and our weakness past comparison , so that we seem to be the thing we most are not .
Come on and kiss me , Kate .
It's nice to see children playing well together .
But not so nice when women misbehave .
Come , Kate , let's go to bed .
We three are married , but you two are defeated .
It's amazing , if I may say so , that she let herself be tamed .
Madam wife , they say I've been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years .
Yes , and it seemed twice as long to me , having been kept from your bed that whole time .
That's too long. , Servants , leave her and me alone .
Now , madam , undress and come to bed .
Thrice noble lord , I beg you to excuse me for another night or two , or at least until nightfall .
Your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you , as there's a risk that you might have a relapse .
I hope this explanation will stand as my excuse .
I'm not sure I can wait that long .
Still , I'd hate to see my former dreams return .
So I Your Honor's actors , hearing of your recovery , have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you , and your doctors approve wholeheartedly .
So they think it's a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment , two strong preventive medicines that foster long life .
Okay , bring on the play .
What , like stuff from a house ?
No , it's a story .
Well , let's watch it .
We're not getting any younger .
I was born in Pisa , famous for its serious citizens , like my father before me ; my father , Vincentio , a successful , world-traveled merchant , was one of the
I'll fix you , I swear .
You thug !
Read your history !
We You won't pay for the glasses you smashed ?
No , not a penny .
Get out of my face .
Go play with yourself .
I know my rights .
I'm not moving an inch , pal .
Let them come , I don't care .
That's good advice .
Wait !
Who are all these people ?
Maybe it's a parade to welcome us to town , master .
Don't worry , I couldn't care less .
The only possible interest I could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool , paint your face with blood , and make a fool out of you .
May the good Lord keep me safe from all women like her !
Me too , Lord !
What a spoiled little brat .
Sister , be happy in my unhappiness. , Sir , I will humbly obey you .
I'll take comfort in my books and music , reading and practicing my instruments .
Listen Tranio !
That's Signior Baptista , will you really be this cruel ?
Why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell , Signor Baptista ?
And because I know how fond she is of music , playing her instruments , and poetry , I plan to hire live-in tutors for her .
Katherina , you may stay .
I don't think so !
Am I to be dictated to , like a child ?
You can go straight to hell !
So long .
That is , if we ever want to return to being rivals for Bianca's love .
And that would be , ?
To find a husband for her sister .
A husband ?
You mean a devil !
I mean a husband .
I say a devil .
Do you really think there's a man fool enough to marry into hell , however rich the father is ?
Oh , I don't know .
Guys who'd take her with all her faults , provided there were enough money involved .
I don't know .
What do you say , Signior Gremio ?
This imaginary suitor for Katherina , I'd buy him the best horse in Padua if he'd get here quickly , woo her , marry her , take her to bed , and rid the house of her .
Let's go .
Sir , is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?
Oh , Tranio , until it happened to me , I never would have thought it possible .
The heart won't be reasoned with .
If love has touched you , love has touched you , end of story .
Yes , you're right .
Please go on .
I feel better already , and I know there's more good advice where that came from .
Master , you were so focused on the girl herself , I wonder if you missed the main point here .
Oh no !
Tranio , I saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath .
Oh , Tranio , what a cruel father he is .
Still , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
I did , and now I've got it !
Tranio , I think I've got it !
I'll bet we're both thinking the same thing , master .
Tell me your idea first .
You will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl .
It is .
Do you think it would work ?
No , not a chance .
Enough !
It's obvious : Here comes Biondello .
Where have you been , boy ?
Where have Come here , boy .
It's no time for jokes : sober up .
Understand ?
Of course , sir .
And you're not to utter a syllable of Tranio's name .
Wish I could say the same .
I'd second your wish if it automatically meant that Lucentio could have Baptista's youngest daughter .
This is for your master's sake , not mine .
When we're by ourselves you can call me "Tranio." Everywhere else , address me as your master Lucentio .
Tranio , let's go .
One last thing , and this is up to you .
You'll have to woo Bianca like the rest .
Don't ask why .
No , no .
Very impressive .
Is there any more , or is that it ?
And what an excellent piece of work it is , too , madam lady !
I wish it were over .
Huntsman , look after my hounds .
Let Merriman catch his breath , the poor dog's foaming at the mouth .
I think Belman is just as good , my lord .
I swear he's the better dog .
You're a fool .
If Echo were as fast , he would be worth a dozen like Belman .
But give them all a good dinner and look after them well .
I'll go hunting again tomorrow , I think .
I will , my lord .
What's this ?
A drunkard or a corpse ?
Check and see if he's breathing .
He is , my lord .
But this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn't warmed himself with ale .
Alas , grim death , how vile and ugly your near-twin , sleep , is !
What do you think ?
I'm off to visit my friends in Padua , particularly my best friend Hortensio .
And I think this is his house .
Here , you there , Grumio .
Knock .
Knock , sir ?
Whom should I knock ?
Has anyone offended your Worship ?
Moron !
I'm telling you to make a fist and pound .
My master is being difficult .
Say , what's the trouble ?
If it isn't my old friend Grumio , and my dear friend Petruchio !
How's everyone in Verona ?
Hortensio , have you come to break up the fight ?
I don't care what he told you in Latin .
I told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it .
Knock at the gate ?
Oh , for Pete's sake !
Didn't you clearly say "Knock , " "pound , " and "put your fists to work" ?
Now you say it was "Knock at the gate" ?
I'm warning you .
Easy , Petruchio .
I'll vouch for Grumio .
Now , my dear friend , what lucky wind blows you in from Verona ?
The wind that scatters young men throughout the world , encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home , where there's little to be found in the way of experience .
I have money in my purse and property at home , so I'm off to see the world .
I doubt you'd thank me in the end , but she's rich , all right , very rich .
But you're too good a friend for me to wish her on you .
Hortensio , good friends like us can get by on a few words .
I can help you find a wife who's rich , young , beautiful , and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman .
Her only flaw , and it's a big one , is that she's unbearable , a total witch , so much so that I wouldn't think of marrying her myself , not even if I were in a worse fix than I am , not for a whole goldmine .
Hush , Hortensio .
You don't know what money can buy .
Her father is Baptista Minola , a pleasant and courteous gentleman .
Her name is Katherina Minola , famous throughout Padua for her scolding tongue .
I don't know her , but I know her father and he knew mine well .
I won't sleep until I see her , Hortensio .
Wait , Petruchio , I should go with you .
His youngest daughter , the beautiful Bianca , is the jewel of my life , and he keeps her hidden away from me and other rivals for her hand .
Katherine the shrew ! " That's the worst thing you can call a young woman .
Now my friend Petruchio will help me out , presenting me to old Baptista as a schoolmaster for Bianca well-versed in music .
I'll disguise myself in somber robes .
Oh , Master , master , look !
Who are these people ?
Hush , Grumio .
It is my rival for Bianca .
Petruchio , let's stand over here awhile .
Oh , what an excellent thing this learning is !
Good to see you , Signior Hortensio .
Do you know where I'm going ?
To Baptista Minola's house .
That's great .
And I have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
Gremio , this is no time to compete over how deeply we love Bianca .
That's good , if he'll really do it .
Have you told him all her faults , Hortensio ?
I know she is a hateful , brawling scold .
If that's all , gentlemen , I see no problem .
No ?
Tell me , friend .
Where are you from ?
My father's dead , and his fortune is mine now .
I hope to see good days , and many of them .
Sir , such a life with such a wife is unlikely !
But if you have the stomach for it , you'll have all the help from me you need .
Do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
Why did I come here if not for that ?
I , who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?
I , who have heard the rumble of guns in battle , and thunder in the sky ( heaven's version of artillery ) .
Listen , Hortensio .
Absolutely , so long as he gets the girl .
I wish I could be as certain of a good dinner .
Is that the man you want ?
But not the woman who scolds , anyway , I hope .
Sir , a word before you go .
Are you a suitor to the girl we speak of , yes or no ?
What if I am ?
Not if you go away , there isn't .
Because , if you must know , she's been chosen by Signior Gremio .
Because she's been chosen by Signior Hortensio .
Wait a minute , gentlemen .
Be good enough to hear me out .
Baptista is a noble gentleman , one to whom my father is not completely unknown , and lovely as his daughter is , she is entitled to any number of suitors , myself among them .
I don't think he'd have any choice , my lord .
When he woke , he wouldn't know where he was .
It would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy .
Well , take him on up and we'll try to pull it off .
Carry him to my best room , gently , so he doesn't wake , and hang all my erotic paintings around him .
Bathe his filthy head with warm , scented water .
Convince him that he has been out of his mind , and when he says he's out of his mind My lord , I promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him .
The beautiful Helen of Troy had a thousand suitors .
This fellow will out-talk us all .
Hortensio , what's all this about ?
Yes , leave that labor to great Hercules , it's worse than the previous twelve put together .
Sir , that's well said and well thought out .
An excellent motion .
Let's go .
I second that
Dear sister , it's unfair to me , and unfair to yourself , to turn me into a slave .
That I won't stand for .
And don't lie .
You lying brat .
It's Hortensio , isn't it ?
Oh , I see .
You'll live in luxury with Gremio .
Is it because of
What , in my presence ?
You mean you don't even want to hear my side ?
Don't talk to me .
Now what ?
Good morning , neighbor Baptista .
Good morning , neighbor Gremio .
And to you , good sir .
Tell me , don't you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named Katherina ?
I have a daughter named Katherina , sir .
Please , Signior Gremio .
Allow me to continue. , I am a gentleman of Verona , sir , who , hearing of your daughter's beauty and wit , her friendly disposition and bashful modesty , her uncommon virtues and her mild behavior , have taken the liberty of presenting myself as a guest at your house in the hope of seeing for myself if what I've heard is true .
You and he are both welcome , sir .
As for my daughter Katherine , this much I know : she's not for you , more's the pity .
I see you don't intend to part with her , or perhaps you don't like my company .
Don't misunderstand me , sir .
I'm just stating the facts as I see them .
Where are you from ?
What's your name ?
My name is Petruchio , son of Antonio , a man well known throughout Italy .
I know him well .
You are welcome for his sake .
You're Forgive me , Signior Gremio , but I'm anxious to get things moving .
No doubt , but you may be going about it the wrong way , Neighbor , this gift is very gracious , I'm sure .
I myself , who am more indebted to you than anyone , have brought you this young scholar
Many thanks , Signior Gremio .
Welcome , good Cambio .
Your name is Lucentio , you say .
Of what city , may I ask ?
A man of great influence .
I know him well by reputation .
You are very welcome here , sir .
Let's take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .
You are all most welcome here ; please make yourselves at home .
Signior Baptista , I'm actually in a bit of a hurry .
You knew my father well ; therefore , you know me , the sole heir to all his property and possessions , which I have added to rather than depleted .
So , tell me , assuming I win your daughter's love , what dowry would she bring to the marriage ?
Twenty thousand crowns now , and half my lands after my death .
Let's have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises .
That counts for everything .
Oh , that's nothing , believe me , sir .
I'm as commanding as she is proud , and when two raging fires meet , they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them .
I'm that great gust to her fire .
Well , good luck !
But prepare yourself for some unpleasantness .
Mountains don't tremble , however much the wind may blow !
Why so pale , my friend ?
Will my daughter be a good musician , do you think ?
I think she'll be a better soldier .
You don't think you can teach her ?
I'll give you frets ! " With that , she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through ,
I like this girl !
Now I want her more than ever .
I can't wait to meet her !
Please do .
I'll wait for her here and when she comes I'll take a novel approach with her .
If she rants , I'll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
If she glares , I'll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .
If she is silent and won't speak at all , I'll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .
If she orders me to go , I'll thank her warmly as if she'd just offered to put me up for a week .
If she refuses my proposal , I'll tell her how much I'm looking forward to the announcement and the wedding .
Carry him gently to bed , and every man be ready at his post when he awakes .
Go , lad , and find out what the trumpet's sounding for .
It's probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey , thinking to spend the night here .
Sir , it's a troupe of actors who want to perform for your Lordship .
Have them come in .
You are welcome here , my friends .
We thank your Honor .
Were you thinking of spending the night here ?
Yes , if that would be all right with your Lordship .
By all means .
I remember this fellow , he once played the eldest son of a farmer .
It was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully .
I have forgotten your name , but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .
Good morning , Kate , for I hear that's what you're called .
Is that what you've heard ?
Driven ? " Really ?
I had you figured for a piece of furniture .
What do you mean by "furniture" ?
A nice stool .
You're right , actually .
Come sit on me .
Asses are made for bearing , and so are you .
Women are made for
Not by the likes of you !
I know how Too light for a lout like you to catch , though no lighter than I should be .
Should be ?
If I'm a wasp , look out for my stinger .
All I have to do is remove it .
True , if a fool such as yourself could find it .
Everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger .
In its tail .
No , in its tongue .
Whose tongue ?
Yours , if we're talking about I'm leaving .
You're leaving with my tongue in your tail ?
No , come back , Kate .
We'll see about that !
I swear I'll smack you if you hit me again .
Not if you want to keep your arms !
It has no fighting spirit .
Oh , come on now , Kate .
Don't look so sour .
That's my way , when I see a crab-apple .
There's no crab-apple here , so don't look sour .
There is a crab-apple here .
Show me .
I would , if I had a mirror .
What , you mean my face looks like a crab-apple ?
You know , you're right .
I probably am too young for you .
Maybe , but you're wrinkled all the same .
Oh , that's with worry .
Well , that doesn't worry me .
Let me go .
No , not a bit .
I find you quite gentle .
I was told that you were violent , proud , and sullen .
You haven't got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do .
No , you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation , quiet and pleasant .
Why does the world report that Kate is lame ?
The world's a liar .
Kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig , her hair as brown as hazelnut shells , and she herself sweeter than the kernels .
Take a few steps , I want to see you walk .
Did Diana ever beautify a grove as much as Kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements ?
It's born of my A witty mother !
Too bad about the son !
Am I not wise ?
I'm the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat Kate into a Kate as gentle and domestic as other household Kates .
I almost recognize that voice .
It's , But he's drowned , and these guys are devils .
Oh , God help me !
Four legs and two voices , a very special monster .
One voice speaks well and talks about his friend .
The other voice is harsh and abusive .
If it takes all the wine in my bottle , I'll cure him .
Come on .
CALIBAN Stephano !
Is your other mouth calling my name ?
Mercy , mercy !
This isn't a monster , it's a devil .
I'll leave him alone .
I have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil .
Stephano !
If you're Stephano , touch me and speak to me .
I'm Trinculo , don't be scared , your good friend Trinculo .
If you're Trinculo , then come out .
I'll pull on these smaller legs .
If any legs here are Trinculo's , these are .
But aren't you drowned , Stephano ?
I hope you're not drowned .
Has the storm passed ?
I hid under this monster's cloak to get out of the storm .
Are you really alive , Stephano ?
Oh , Stephano , two men from Naples survived !
Please stop turning me around .
My stomach's a little upset .
I swam ashore like a duck .
I can swim like a duck , I swear .
Here ,
Oh Stephano , do you have any more of that wine ?
I've got the whole barrel , man .
You come from heaven , don't you ?
No , from the moon , I'm telling you .
I used to be the man in the moon a long time ago .
My mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .
I can't believe I was scared of him !
A pretty pathetic monster .
The man in the moon !
What a poor , gullible monster. , That was a nice big gulp , monster !
What a lying , drunken monster .
When his god falls asleep , the monster will snatch his wine bottle .
Come on , then .
Get down and swear it .
I'm going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster .
A rotten , foolish monster .
I could find it in my heart to beat him , Come on , kiss my feet .
An awful monster !
I'll show you where to get fresh water .
I'll pick berries for you .
I'll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood .
The tyrant I'm serving now can go to hell !
What a silly monster , to think a poor drunk is wonderful .
Show us the way without further delay. , Trinculo , since the king and all our comrades are drowned , we're the heirs of this place. , Here , carry my wine bottle. , Trinculo , my buddy , we'll get that bottle refilled soon enough .
A loud-mouthed , drunken monster .
Good monster !
Show us the way .
Right now I'd give a thousand
Some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons .
And you can do poor things that lead to rich results .
This hard work would be boring and nasty to me , but I'm working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor .
Oh , she's ten times nicer than her father is mean , and he's the height of crabbiness .
I have thousands of logs to take away and pile up , on strict orders from him .
My sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .
These sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me , especially when I'm slaving away busily .
Now , please , I beg you , don't work so hard .
I wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you've been ordered to stack !
Please put that log down and rest a while .
When this wood burns , it'll weep for making you tired .
My father's studying hard , so he won't see you .
So please rest .
We're safe from my father for at least three hours .
Oh , my dear mistress , I won't be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .
If you sit down , I'll carry your logs a while .
Please give me that .
I'll take it over to the pile .
I'd be as right for the job as you are , and I'd do it more easily , since I'd have good will on my side .
You look tired .
I beg you to tell me your name so I can use it in my prayers .
Miranda. , Oh father , I've disobeyed you by telling him that !
I've looked at many ladies with pleasure , and been
But with you it's different .
You're perfect , without a rival in the world , made up of the best qualities of every creature .
I've never known any woman or seen a woman's face , except my own in the mirror .
And I've never met any men besides you and my father .
I'm a prince by birth , Miranda , maybe even a king now ; though I wish I weren't , and normally I wouldn't put up with carrying these logs any more than I'd let flies breed in my mouth .
But I'll tell you something from my soul .
The second I saw you , my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave , so here I am now , a patient log-man .
Do you love me ?
Oh heaven , oh earth , witness what I'm about to say , and reward me if I tell the truth !
If I'm lying , then
More than anything else in the world , I love you , value you , and honor you .
Look at me crying , what a fool I am to cry at what makes me happy .
Why are you crying ?
I'm crying at how unworthy I am to give you what I want to give you and to take what I'm dying to have .
The more I try to hide what I'm feeling , the bigger it gets .
I'll be your wife if you'll have me .
Otherwise , I'll die a virgin , devoted to you .
You can refuse to make me your spouse , but I'll be your servant whether you want me to or not .
You'll be my wife , dearest , and I'll serve you forever .
Will you be my husband , then ?
A million goodbyes to you .
Now it's time to get back to my studying , since I have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner .
Don't tell me that .
When the barrel's empty , we'll drink water .
Not one drop sooner .
Therefore , drink up. , Servant-monster , drink a toast to me .
Servant monster" ?
What a crazy island this is .
They say there are only five people on it .
We're three of them .
If the other two are as loopy as we are , our country's in bad shape .
Drink when I order you , servant-monster .
Your eyes look like they've sunk into your head .
Where else should his eyes be , if not in his head ?
He'd be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail .
My man , monster is so drunk he can't talk .
He's not standing straight enough to hold a flag .
We're not going to run in our army , Monsieur Monster .
Or walk either .
You'll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing .
Monster sweetie , be a good monster and just speak once .
How is your Highness ?
Let me lick your shoe .
Lord , " he calls you ?
What an idiot that monster is !
Trinculo , speak politely .
If you mutiny against me , I'll hang you from the next tree .
Thank you , my noble lord .
Now would you please listen once again to the request I made to you earlier ?
I'll stand , and so will Trinculo .
You lie .
Trinculo , if you interrupt him any more , I swear I'll knock some teeth out of your head .
I didn't say anything .
Okay , just stay quiet .
Go on .
I was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .
He stole it from me .
If your highness is willing , take revenge on him for that , because I know you're brave enough , I don't dare to , That's for sure .
You'll be lord of the island then , and I'll be your servant .
And how would we go about doing that ?
Can you bring me to him ?
Yes , yes , my lord .
I'll take you to where he sleeps , and you can pound a nail into his head .
You lie .
You can't do that .
What an idiot this guy is ! , You're a rotten piece of work ! , I beg your highness , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
When he loses that , he'll be drinking salt water , since I'll never tell him where the freshwater springs are .
Trinculo , watch out .
If you interrupt this monster with one more word , I'll beat you like a piece of salted fish .
What did I do ?
I didn't do anything .
I need to get away from you .
Didn't you call him a liar ?
You lie .
I didn't accuse you of lying .
Are you out of your mind and deaf too ?
Damn your wine !
Ha , ha , ha !
Now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story. , Please go stand farther away .
Beat him up .
After a little while , I'll beat him too .
Just as I told you , he usually sleeps in the afternoon .
At that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books ; or you can bash his skull with a log ; or you can stab him in the belly ; or cut his windpipe .
Just remember to grab his books first , since without them he's just a poor fool like me , and can't command a single spirit .
All the spirits hate him as much as I do .
Be sure to burn his magic books .
He has some wonderful home furnishings , that's what he calls them , that he'll use to decorate his house when he gets one .
The most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .
He says she has no equal .
I never saw a woman except her and Sycorax , my mother .
But Miranda is so much more beautiful , you can't even compare the two .
Is she really that wonderful ?
Yes , my lord .
Monster , I'll kill this man .
His daughter and I will be king and queen , God protect us ! , and you and Trinculo will be our governors. , Do you like that idea , Trinculo ?
Excellent .
Give me your hand .
I'm sorry I hit you .
But try to control your speech .
In a half an hour he'll be asleep .
Will you kill him then ?
Dear father , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers , please put an end to it .
The sky's so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren't swelling up to the sky to put its fire out .
Oh , I suffered along with all the men I watched suffer !
A fine ship , with some good people in it , I'm sure , smashed to pieces .
Their dying shouts broke my heart !
The poor people died .
If I'd been a god I would've let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying .
Calm down .
There's nothing to get upset about .
No harm was done .
Oh , what a horrible day !
There was no harm , I'm telling you .
It never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .
Yes , I swear .
You make me so happy .
I'm full of joy .
Let's be light-hearted .
I'll do anything you ask , monster , anything reasonable. , Come on , Trinculo , let's sing .
That's not the tune I had in mind .
What's this song ?
Oh , forgive all my sins !
Are you scared ?
No , monster , not me .
Don't be scared .
This'll be a wonderful kingdom to live in , where they play music for free .
As soon as you kill Prospero .
That'll happen soon enough .
I remember the plan .
The sound is going away .
But let's follow it , and then do our dirty work afterward .
Lead us , monster ; we'll follow .
I wish I could see this invisible drummer .
He really plays well .
Are you coming monster ?
My old bones are tired .
We're wandering in a maze .
If you don't mind , I need to rest a bit .
I can't blame you , old lord .
Sit down and rest .
We're searching on land , but he's lost in the sea .
We have to give up and let him go .
What's that music ?
My friends , listen .
What marvelous music !
Heaven help us !
What were those things ?
Now I'll believe that unicorns exist , and that there's a tree in Arabia where the phoenix lives .
Travelers have never told lies , no matter what the fools at home accuse them of .
If I told them about this back in Naples , would they believe me ?
I'd tell them that I saw natives like these , since they must be natives , who are graceful and well-mannered even if they're monstrous to look at , kinder than most human beings you might find , kinder than almost any human .
They vanished strangely .
It's all right , since they left their food behind , and we're hungry .
Would you like to taste the banquet ?
Not me .
I assure you , sir , there's nothing to be afraid of .
Brother , Duke , please have some food .
Oh , it's horrible , horrible .
I thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared Prospero's name .
It sang about my crimes .
I'll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .
I'll fight every one of these devils if I have to , one at a time .
I'll back you up .
All three of them are crazy with despair .
Their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them , like a slow-acting poison .
Those of you who are young and active , I beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do .
Follow them , please .
But if you have sex with her before the marriage ceremony takes place , the heavens will not bless your relationship , but will overwhelm you with hate , contempt , and discord , and will poison your marriage bed so that you both grow to loathe it .
You've said it well .
So have a seat and talk to her .
She's yours. , Come , Ariel !
My trusty servant , Ariel !
What does my powerful master wish for ?
I'm here .
You and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well , and now I need your help again .
Go bring them all here ; I give you power over them .
I've promised them I would , and they're expecting it .
Right now ?
Yes , right away .
Before you can say "Come" and "Go , " And breathe twice , and shout "So , so ! " Each one of your servants will rush here ,
It's time for you to know the whole story .
Give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak .
Not yet." Well , the time has come .
Can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack ?
I doubt it , since you weren't even three at the time .
Sure I can , father .
What do you remember ?
A house , a person ?
Tell me anything you remember .
I love you dearly , Ariel .
Don't come near till you hear me call you .
All right , I understand .
I assure you , sir , the tender love I feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below .
Good. , Now come , Ariel !
Better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed .
Appear before me now quickly , No talking .
Just watch !
Be quiet .
I have come to announce that Juno has asked you , Ceres , goddess of the fields and the earth , to leave your rich farms of wheat , rye , barley , oats , and peas , the hills where the
Why has your queen , Juno , called me here to this grassy spot ?
To celebrate a marriage of true love , and give a gift to the lovers .
Tell me , rainbow , do you know if either Venus , the goddess of love , or her son , Cupid , is accompanying Queen Juno ?
Ever since Venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year , I swore I'd never speak to them again .
Don't be afraid of her company .
I met Venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on Paphos , in a carriage pulled by doves .
They were planning to pull a mischievous trick on Ferdinand and Miranda , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day .
But their trick failed .
Venus went home again , and her little son broke all his arrows , swearing he'll never shoot them again , but play with birds like other little boys .
Great Queen Juno is coming .
I know her by her walk .
How is my generous sister ?
Come help me bless this couple , so they will be prosperous and have many children .
This is a majestic and harmonious vision .
Are these spirits we see before us ?
Yes , they're spirits that I've called out of their prisons to perform my whims .
Let me live here forever .
Such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise .
Now be quiet .
Juno and Ceres are whispering about something serious .
There's something else to be done .
Be silent , or else my magic spell will be broken .
Come , sweet nymphs , and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers .
Don't be late .
Now , you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of August's labors , get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here .
Put your straw hats on , have some fun , and dance with these young nymphs .
The moment they planned to act is almost here .
I've never seen him like this .
We are all made of dreams , and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death .
Sir , I'm upset .
Please put up with my weakness .
My old brain is troubled .
Don't be disturbed by my illness .
If you like , you can rest a while in my room .
I'll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind .
We hope you feel better and find some peace .
Come , Ariel , I summon you with a thought .
Thank you , Ariel .
Come .
I obey all your thoughts .
What do you wish ?
Spirit , we have to get ready to meet with Caliban .
Yes , my master .
When I was putting on the Ceres show , I thought of reminding you about Caliban , but I was afraid of upsetting you .
Tell me again , where did you leave those lowlifes ?
I told you , sir , they were totally drunk , so puffed up with courage that they were getting angry at the air for blowing in their faces , and beating the ground for touching their feet , yet even when drunk , they kept their plan firmly in mind .
Then I beat my drum , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes , looking around for the source of my music .
I enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins .
In the end I left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .
Good job , my little one .
Stay invisible .
Bring the fancy clothes out of my house , to use as bait to catch these thieves .
I'm going , I'm going .
He's a devil , a born devil , who can never be trained .
As his body grows uglier with age , his mind rots away as well .
I'll torment them all till they roar with pain .
Here , hang them on this clothesline .
Please walk softly , so not even a mole hears us approach .
We're near his room now .
Hey monster , the spirit you've been talking about , the one you call harmless , has been playing tricks on us .
Monster , I smell like horse piss , which is making my nose pretty upset .
Mine too. , Are you listening , monster ?
If I decide to get angry at you , just watch out , You'd be done for then , monster .
My good lord , I still need you to like me .
Be patient , because the prize I'm leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .
So be quiet .
It's as silent as a graveyard here .
That upsets me much more than getting wet .
And you called the fairy creature harmless , monster .
Please , my king , be quiet .
Look here , this is the entrance to his room .
Be silent and go in .
Do the deed that will make this island yours forever , and will make me , Caliban , your worshipful foot-licker .
Give me your hand .
I'm starting to feel murderous urges .
Leave it alone , you fool .
It's worthless .
Oh , monster , we know secondhand clothes when we see them. , Take off that gown , Trinculo .
I swear that gown's for me .
You can have it then , your highness .
To hell with this idiot !
Why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes ?
Leave them alone , and do the murder first .
If he wakes up before we kill him , he'll never stop punishing us .
Thank you kindly .
Thank you for that joke .
As king of this country I like to reward wit when I hear it .
Here's another jacket to say thanks .
Come here , monster , put some glue on your fingers , and carry away the rest of these clothes for us .
I won't have any of this .
Monster , use your fingers .
Help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden , or I'll kick you out of my kingdom .
Go on , take them .
Take these too .
Yes , and these .
Hey , Mountain , hey !
Silver .
There they go , Silver !
My memory is hazy , more like a dream than a recollection .
Didn't I use to have four or five women taking care of me ?
Indeed you did , and more besides , Miranda .
But how is it possible that you still remember this , through all the darkness of the past ?
If you remember your life before you came here , you may also remember how you got here .
No , that I don't remember .
Twelve years ago , Miranda , twelve years ago your father was the Duke of Milan , a powerful prince .
Aren't you my father ?
Your mother was extremely virtuous , and she said you were my daughter .
And your father was Duke of Milan , and you were his heir , a princess .
Good lord !
What evil things were done to us that we were driven here ?
Or was it a blessing that we came here ?
Both , both , my girl .
We were pushed out of power by evil deeds , as you call them .
Fury , Fury ! , Get over there , Tyrant , there .
Listen , listen !
Ariel , go order my goblin servants to make these fellows ' bones ache , give them muscle cramps all over , and give them more bruises than leopards have spots .
Listen they're howling .
Hunt them down .
Now all my enemies are at my mercy .
Soon all my work will be done , and you'll be free .
Just obey me a little bit longer .
My plans are almost at their climax .
My spells are working well , my spirits are obeying me , and everything is right on schedule .
What time is it ?
It's after six o'clock , my lord , when you said our work would be finished .
That's what I said when I first conjured the tempest .
Tell me , spirit , how's the king and his entourage ?
All cooped up together , just as you ordered , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather .
They can't move till you release them .
The king , his brother , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind , and the rest are grieving over them , sad and astonished .
Good old lord Gonzalo , " as you call him , is saddest of all , with tears running down his beard .
Your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now , you'd feel sorry for them .
Do you think so , spirit ?
I'd feel sorry for them , if I were human .
I will too .
It's better to act virtuously rather than vengefully .
Go release them , Ariel .
I'll break my spells and bring them back to their senses , and they'll feel like themselves again .
I'll go get them , sir .
With his own lightning bolts ; I've shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars ; I've opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them , letting them out with my powerful magic .
But I surrender all this magic now , when I've summoned some heavenly music to cast a spell , as I'm doing now , I'll break my staff and bury it far underground , and throw my book of magic spells deeper into the sea than any anchor ever sank .
Let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds , which are now useless , seething inside your skulls. , All of you stand there in my spell. ,
Why , that's my dainty Ariel singing now .
I'll miss you , Ariel , but you'll be free. , Yes , you will , yes. , Go to the king's ship in your invisible state .
This place is full of trouble , torments , and amazements .
There must be a strange explanation for this , if it's true .
I surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes .
But how is it possible that Prospero's alive and well and living on this island ?
I won't bet on whether or not any of this is real .
Welcome , my friends .
It's the devil speaking through him .
You suffered a loss like mine ?
Yes , just as great and just as recent .
And I have much less to comfort me than you do , since I've lost my daughter .
A daughter ?
Oh God , I wish the two of them were alive and living in Naples , as king and queen !
I'd give up my life and take my son's place in the mud on the ocean floor if I could see them alive in Naples. , When did you lose your daughter ?
In this recent storm .
These lords seem so astonished that they've lost their use of reason and can hardly believe what they see with their own eyes. , But whatever the reason for your losing your senses , you can know for sure that I'm Prospero , that same duke who was kicked out of Milan and landed on this same island where you landed , and became the lord of it .
No , my dearest love , I wouldn't cheat you for the whole world .
If this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up , then I'll lose my son twice .
A wonderful miracle !
Receive all the blessings of a happy father .
Get up and tell me how you came here .
How amazing !
How many wonderful creatures there are here !
Mankind is so beautiful !
Oh , what a wonderful new world , that has such people in it !
It's new to you .
No , sir , she's human .
But by the grace of God , she's mine .
I chose her for my wife when I thought I had no father to ask advice of .
She's the daughter of this famous Duke of Milan I heard so much about but never saw before .
He's given me a second life , and marrying her makes him a second father to me .
And I'm her father as well .
But oh , how odd it is to have to ask for my child's forgiveness !
Stop right there , sir .
Let's not get gloomy in our reminiscing , since there's no reason for sadness anymore .
Oh , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this , things that I can't remember .
But please tell me more .
My brother , your uncle Antonio , just listen to this ( I still can't believe a brother could be so disloyal !
My brother whom , aside from you , I loved more than anyone else in the world , I trusted to run my state , which at that time was the strongest in the land , and Prospero the number one duke , famous for my dignity and my education .
Since I was so drawn to studying things like logic , grammar , geometry , and astronomy , I let my control of the government slide a bit , being too wrapped up in my occult books .
Your disloyal uncle , are you paying attention ?
I'm hanging on every word .
Oh , yes I am , father .
Dear gods , bless this couple , since you're the ones who have shown us the path that led us here .
Amen to that , Gonzalo .
Was the Duke of Milan kicked out of Milan so his children could become kings of Naples ?
Oh , this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever .
On one and the same trip Claribel found a husband in Tunis , and Ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he was shipwrecked ; Prospero found his dukedom on a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
So be it .
Amen .
Oh , look , sir , look , sir !
More of us are here .
The best news of all is that we've located our king and our men .
The next bit of good news is that our ship , which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago , is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail .
These are unnatural events .
In an instant we were separated from them , as if in a dream , and brought here in a daze .
This is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before , and it's not natural either .
We need some oracle to tell us what's going on .
Sir , my king , don't waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .
How is my lord ?
If I can believe my eyes , this is a fine sight to see .
Oh Setebos , these are handsome spirits !
How wonderful my master is !
I'm afraid he'll punish me .
Ha , ha !
What are these things we're looking at , my lord Antonio ?
Can you buy them with money ?
He'll kill me with tortures .
Isn't this Stephano , my drunken butler ?
He's definitely drunk now .
Where did he get wine ?
And Trinculo's drunk .
How are you doing , Stephano ?
Oh , don't touch me .
I'm not Stephano , I'm a walking cramp .
You wanted to be king of the island , sir ?
I would've been a sore king then .
He's as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance. , I will indeed .
And after this I'll be good and hope you forgive me .
What an idiot I was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool !
Go away , now .
Or stole it , rather .
And in the morning I'll take you to your ship and we'll sail to Naples , where I hope to see this loving couple married .
I'm dying to hear your life story , which must be a strange tale .
Now my spells are all broken , And the only power I have is my own , Which is very weak .
Release me So I can return to my dukedom With your help .
Just as you'd like to have your sins forgiven , Indulge me , forgive me , and set me free .
Please listen to me carefully .
As I neglected practical matters , being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine , I was so shut away from the world that I unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother .
My deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy , arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was , my trust which had no limit , an infinite confidence .
With his ambition growing like this , do you hear what I'm saying ?
Of course I hear it .
My library was a large enough dukedom for me .
Good heavens !
Think about that , and about what followed afterward .
Then tell me if Antonio can be called a brother .
It would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother .
The king of Naples , my arch-enemy , listens to my brother's request , which was that the king , in exchange for the respect and money paid to him , would get rid of me and make my brother Duke of Milan instead .
How awful !
I can't remember how I cried then , but I'll cry all over again .
This story breaks my heart .
Just listen a little more , and I'll bring you up to date about the present situation , which is the whole reason I'm telling you this story in the first place .
Why didn't they just kill us that night ?
Good question , my girl .
My story does raise that question .
The answer , my dear , is that they didn't dare , because the people of Milan loved me too much .
God , what a burden on you I must have been !
No , my dear , you were a little angel who kept me going .
You smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven , while I cried salty tears into the salty sea , and groaned at our situation .
How did we manage to get ashore ?
With God's help .
We had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from Naples , Gonzalo , had given us out of the kindness of his heart .
Knowing how much I loved my books , he gave me some books from my library that I value more than my dukedom .
I wish I could see that man someday !
Now I'll stand up .
May God thank you for it .
But please , father , the question is still nagging at me , why did you conjure up this storm ?
You should know this : much luck is on my side , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .
Now , no more questions .
It's a nice hazy feeling , so give in to it .
I know you have no choice .
Come on , servant , come .
I'm ready now .
Come here , Ariel .
Humble greetings , great master !
Worthy sir , greetings !
Spirit , did you carry out the storm just as I ordered ?
Sometimes I appeared in many places at once .
I flashed about faster than lightning .
Good spirit !
Boatswain !
I'm here , sir .
Hurry , hurry !
Come on , men !
That's the way to do it !
Where's the Master ?
Make these men work .
Please stay below deck , sir .
Where's the Master , Boatswain ?
Everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts .
Everyone except the sailors dove into the sea , leaving behind the ship that I had set on fire .
The king's son , Ferdinand , with his hair standing straight up , it looked like reeds , not hair , was the first person to jump , shouting , "Hell is empty , and all the devils are here ! " Good job !
But was this near the shore ?
Very near , my master .
But are they all safe , Ariel ?
Nobody was hurt in the slightest .
Even their clothes are unstained , and look fresher than before the storm .
I've separated them into groups around the island , just as you ordered .
I sent the king's son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island , where he's sitting now sighing , with his arms crossed like this .
Tell me what you did with the king's ship , the sailors , and the other ships .
The sailors are all below deck , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell I cast over them .
As for the rest of the ships , I scattered them , and they've gathered again in the Mediterranean , sailing sadly home to Naples , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king .
Ariel , you've done your work exactly as I ordered .
But there's more work to be done .
What time is it ?
Past noon .
At least two hours past .
We can't waste time between now and six o'clock .
Is there more work to do ?
Since you're giving me new assignments , let me remind you what you promised me but haven't come through with yet .
What ?
You're in a bad mood ?
What could you possibly ask for ?
My freedom .
Before your sentence has been completed ?
Don't say anything else .
I beg you , remember the good work I've done for you , and how I've never lied to you , never made mistakes , and never grumbled in my work .
You promised to take a full year off my sentence .
Have you forgotten the torture I freed you from ?
No .
You have forgotten , and you think it's a burden when I ask you to walk through the ocean , or run on the north wind , or do business for me underground when the earth's frozen solid .
No , I don't , sir .
You lie , you nasty , ungrateful thing !
Have you forgotten the horrid witch Sycorax , stooped over with old age and ill will ?
Have you forgotten her ?
No , sir .
You have .
Where was she born ?
Speak .
Tell me .
In Algiers , sir .
Oh , was she now ?
I'll have to tell the story again every month , since you seem to forget it .
This damned witch Sycorax was kicked out of Algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .
But for one reason they refused to execute her .
Isn't that true ?
Yes , sir .
This sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors .
You , my slave , were her servant at the time , as you admit yourself .
In a fit of rage she locked you up in a hollow pine tree , with the help of her powerful assistants , and left you there for twelve years .
That's right , you stupid thing .
Caliban , who now serves me .
It was my magic that saved you when I arrived on the island and heard you , making the pine tree open and let you out .
Thank you , master .
If you complain any more , I'll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you've howled for twelve years .
Please forgive me , master .
I'll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining .
Do that , and I'll set you free in two days .
That's noble of you , master .
What shall I do for you ?
Just tell me .
What shall I do ?
Go disguise yourself as a sea nymph .
Be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .
Take this garment , put it on , and then come back here .
Hurry , go !
Shake off your sleepiness .
Come on .
We'll go visit Caliban , my slave who always talks to us so nastily .
But even so , we can't do without him .
He builds our fires , gets our firewood , and does all kinds of useful things for us. , Hey !
Caliban !
Pile of dirt !
Say something .
Come out , I order you .
There's other work for you to do .
Come on , you turtle !
What a fine sight !
My dear clever Ariel , listen carefully .
My lord , I'll do it right away .
I hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow's feather from the poison swamps .
May a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over .
I'll give you cramps for saying that , horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing .
I'll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you .
You'll be pricked all over , and it'll sting like bees .
I have to eat my dinner now .
This island belongs to me because Sycorax , my mother , left it to me .
I curse myself for doing that !
You liar , you respond better to the whip than to kindness !
I took good care of you , piece of filth that you are , and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter .
Oh ho , oh ho !
I wish I had !
You stopped me .
You horrid slave , you can't be trained to be good , and you're capable of anything evil !
I pitied you , worked hard to teach you to speak , and taught you some new thing practically every hour .
But you had bad blood in you , no matter how much you learned , and good people couldn't stand to be near you .
So you got what you deserved , and were locked up in this cave , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be .
You taught me language , and all I can do with it is curse .
Damn you for teaching me your language !
No , please .
Go then , slave .
The watchdogs bark .
Listen , listen !
Where's that music coming from ?
From the earth , or the air ?
It's stopped now , it must be played for some local god of the island .
As I sat on the shore crying over my father's shipwreck , I heard the music creep over the wild waves , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
I followed it here , or I should say it dragged me here .
But now it's stopped .
No , there it is again .
Listen , I hear them .
This song's about my dead father .
I hear it now overhead .
What is it ?
A spirit ?
Lord , it's glancing every which way !
How handsome it is .
It must be a spirit .
No , girl !
It eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do .
He's lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them .
He's busy , can't you hear him giving orders ?
You're getting in the way of our work .
Stay in your cabins .
You're helping the storm , not us .
Don't get wound up , my good man .
Now get out of here !
Go to your cabins and be quiet !
Don't bother us up here .
Just remember who you've got on board with you , good man .
Nobody I care about more than myself .
You're a king's advisor .
Go ahead , use your authority .
If you can't do it , be grateful you've lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin , if it comes to that. , Harder , men ! , Now get out of our way , I'm telling you .
I feel a lot better after talking to this guy .
I could imagine he's divine , since I never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before .
I'm not marvelous , sir , but I'm certainly a maiden .
She speaks my language !
My God , I'm the highest-ranking person who speaks this language , if only we were back where it's spoken .
What's that ?
The highest-ranking ?
What would the King of Naples do if he heard you say that ?
He would just see me for what I am , a person amazed to hear you talking about Naples .
He does hear me , and that makes me cry .
I myself am the King of Naples , since I saw with my own eyes , these eyes that haven't been dry since , my father killed in a shipwreck .
Ah , how pitiful !
Yes , indeed , and all the King's men , the Duke of Milan and his fine son too .
Hang on , sir !
Just a moment .
If the devil had such a beautiful house as his body , then good things would fight to live in it .
What's that ?
Get out of that position , because I can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop .
Please , father , I beg you .
Let go of me !
Don't tug on my clothes .
Father , take pity on him .
Quiet !
If you say one more word , I'll punish you , maybe even hate you .
You're defending an impostor ?
You think he's special , since you've only ever seen him and Caliban .
Foolish girl , in the eyes of most people this man's a Caliban , and compared to him , they're angels .
Then my love is humble .
I don't feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one .
That's true , they are .
My strength is all gone , as if in a dream .
The death of my father , my physical weakness , the loss of all my friends , the threats of this man who's taken me prisoner , all that would be easy for me to take , if only I could look through my prison windows once a day and see this girl .
A prison like that would give me enough liberty .
Please say no more .
What a pain .
Pain , yes indeed .
You thought you were being funny , but you said the truth .
You're taking it more seriously than I meant it .
Well , I'm nearly finished .
Which one will start yammering first , Gonzalo or Adrian ?
The old guy .
I pick the younger one .
You're on .
What's the prize ?
A good laugh .
It's a deal !
Though this island may appear desolate ,
The island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .
I knew Temperance , she was a fine girl .
Yes , and she was mild too .
There's always a breath of fresh air here .
Stinking like a swamp .
This island contains everything beneficial to life .
True .
Everything except something to live on .
There's little or nothing of that .
Look how lush and healthy the grass is !
How green !
The ground is brown .
With a touch of green in it .
He doesn't miss a thing .
No , he just gets reality completely wrong .
But the really unbelievable thing is , and this is incredible , As most unbelievable things are .
That our clothes were drenched with sea water , but they came out looking brand-new .
Or stuff what he says into their pockets .
Seriously , I think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in Africa , when we attended the marriage of the king's daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis .
It was a lovely wedding , and we're doing really well on our trip home .
Tunis has never had such a beautiful queen .
Next thing you know , he'll be saying "widower Aeneas." "Widow Dido , " did you say ?
I'm not sure about that .
Dido was from Carthage , not Tunis .
Carthage ?
I'm telling you , it was Carthage .
Gonzalo is a miracle-worker .
What miracle will he work next ?
I think he'll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple .
And then throw the seeds in the sea , to make more islands grow .
Yes indeed .
Absolutely , yes indeed .
Bring down that top sail !
Fast !
Let the ship sail close to the wind .
Damn those men shouting down there !
They're louder than the storm or us sailors .
Oh , not you again .
What do you want ?
Should we all give up and drown ?
Do you want to sink ?
Yes , I guarantee he won't drown , even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman .
Turn the ship to the wind !
It's no use !
We're done for !
The most beautiful queen they ever had .
I beg your pardon , except for the widow Dido .
Oh , except for the widow Dido ?
That's right , except for the widow Dido .
Isn't my vest just as clean and fresh as the day I put it on ?
In a way , I mean .
In a way" is the right way to go .
I mean when I wore it at your daughter's wedding .
You keep cramming words into my ears that I don't want to hear .
Sir , he may still be alive .
I have no doubt he got ashore alive .
No , no , he's dead .
Please be quiet .
We all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an African and the desire to obey you .
Now I'm afraid we've lost your son forever .
Our shipwreck has made more women widows in Milan and Naples than there are survivors to comfort them .
And it's all your fault .
And the greatest sorrow is mine too .
My lord Sebastian , even though what you say is true , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time .
You're rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .
All right , I'll stop .
Like a good doctor .
Bad times ?
Yes , very bad .
If I could colonize this island , my lord , He'd cultivate weeds on it .
Or thorn-bushes .
And if I were king of it , you know what I'd do ?
He wouldn't get drunk much , since there's no wine here .
I wouldn't allow any commerce .
There'd be no work .
There'd be no kingship , He wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
Everything would be produced without labor , and would be shared by all .
Nature would produce its harvests in abundance , to feed my innocent people .
There'd be no marriage ?
No .
Oh , please be quiet .
You're absolutely right , your highness .
It's you we were laughing at .
Ouch , what a comeback !
Too bad it fell flat .
You're brave gentlemen .
You'd give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit .
That's right , and then after we fixed the moon , we'd go bird-hunting .
I'm not .
Go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
What , everybody falls asleep so fast ?
I wish I could sleep too , it would stop me from thinking .
Come to think of it , I am feeling sleepy .
In that case you should sleep .
The two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .
Thank you .
I'm terribly sleepy .
How strange that they all got so sleepy !
There must be something in the air here .
So why aren't our eyelids heavy ?
I'm not sleepy at all .
Me neither .
I'm wide awake .
They all fell asleep together , as if they'd planned it .
Opportunity's knocking for you , and in my imagination I see a crown dropping onto your head .
Are you dreaming or awake ?
Don't you hear me speaking ?
I do , and it sounds like you're talking in your sleep .
What did you say ?
You're snoring , but it sounds like you're talking .
There's meaning in your snoring .
I'll show you how .
You need to .
Oh , if you only knew how close to success you are , even while you make fun of what I'm telling you !
The more you joke about it , the more clearly I feel how serious it is !
Lazy people end up at the bottom , and you deserve to be at the top .
Please , tell me more .
Yes , I'm sure he's dead .
I've got no hope that he survived .
But in that "no hope" there are great hopes for you !
Do you agree that Ferdinand must have drowned ?
He's dead .
So , in that case , tell me who's next in line to inherit the kingdom of Naples ?
Claribel , his daughter .
It's true that my brother's daughter is Queen of Tunis , and heir of Naples .
I could do it myself .
Do you even get what I'm saying ?
I think I do .
And does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
I remember you took the throne from your brother Prospero .
My brother's servants used to be my equals .
Now they work for me .
But what about your guilty conscience ?
Yes .
I don't feel anything .
As
for the other men , we can make them believe anything we choose .
They'll set their watches to whatever time we say .
You'll be my role model .
Just as you got Milan , I'll get Naples .
Take out your sword .
With one cut you can be through paying money to Naples .
And as king I'll love you forever .
You take out your sword too .
When I raise my hand , you do the same , and bring it down on Gonzalo's head .
Oh , but there's one more thing to tell you .
What , we're going to die ?
The king and the prince are praying .
I'm out of patience .
This bigmouth jerk here , ( He'll still die by hanging , not drowning , even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him .
Let's all sink with the king .
Let's say goodbye to him .
Let's act quickly .
Why are your swords out ?
Why do you look like that ?
What's this all about ?
While we were here guarding you as you slept , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls , or lions .
Didn't you hear it ?
We heard it very clearly .
I didn't hear anything .
Oh , it was a monstrous roar , to make the earth tremble !
I'm sure there was a herd of lions nearby .
Did you hear this , Gonzalo ?
It's true I heard a humming sound , a strange one , which woke me up .
I shook you and shouted at you , sir .
When I opened my eyes , I saw their swords out .
There was a noise , that's certainly true .
Let's draw our own swords too .
I hope those lions stay far away from him .
I'm sure he's somewhere on the island .
Get us out of here .
His spirits are listening to me , but I can't help cursing him anyway .
They won't pinch me , frighten me , push me in the mud , or mislead me unless he tells them to .
Sometimes snakes wrap around me , hissing at me with their forked tongues till I go crazy .
Hey , look over there !
Maybe he won't see me .
There are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here .
And there's another storm brewing , I can hear it in the way the wind whistles .
That huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that's about to pour out its contents .
A strange fish .
If I were in England now , like I was once , and I had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
In England this strange monster would be just like a man .
Any strange beast there can be considered a man .
The men there won't give a penny to a lame beggar , but they'll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit .
This guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !
And he's still warm , by God .
I guess this is not a fish , but a native who got struck by lightning just now .
Oh , here comes the storm again .
The best thing to do is crawl under his cloak .
There's no other shelter around here .
In emergencies you meet the strangest folks .
I'll just stay here till the storm passes .
This is a rotten song to sing at a man's funeral .
At least I've got some booze to comfort me .
Don't hurt me .
Oh !
What's going on ?
Do we have devils on the island ?
Are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the Indies , ha ?
I didn't survive a shipwreck so I could be scared of your four legs now .
The spirit is torturing me .
Oh !
This is some monster of the island , with four legs , who seems to me to have some kind of ache .
How the hell does he know our language ?
I'll help out , if only because he speaks the same language as me .
If I can cure him from his fever and tame him , and get him back to Naples , he'd make a great present for any emperor .
Don't hurt me , please .
I promise I'll carry the wood faster .
He's having a fit and talking nonsense .
I'll give him some liquor .
If he's never drunk it before , it'll help soothe his fever .
If I can tame him , I'll charge as much as I can get for him .
He'll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that's for sure .
