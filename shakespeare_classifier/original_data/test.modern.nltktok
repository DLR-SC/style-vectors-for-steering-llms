A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .
And now you've changed ?
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .
And you told me to bury my love .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .
The other girl did not love me .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .
Let's get out of here .
I'm in a rush .
Go wisely and slowly .
Those who rush stumble and fall .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?
Didn't he come home last night ?
Not to his father's house .
I asked a servant .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .
I bet it's a challenge .
Romeo will answer the challenge .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .
Oh , poor Romeo !
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?
He knows what ?
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .
Now he's ready for
Good morning to you both .
What do you mean I faked you out ?
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?
The Right .
My employer is as good as yours .
But he's not better than mine .
Well then .
You lie .
Gregory , remember how to slash .
What ?
Come break this up , Benvolio .
I'm losing this duel of wits .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .
No , good goose , don't bite me .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?
Now you're sociable .
Now you're Romeo .
Oh , you're wrong .
I would have made it short .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .
Here's something good .
There's two , a man and a woman .
Peter !
I'm at your service .
Give me my fan , Peter .
Good morning , gentlemen .
Good afternoon , fair lady .
Is it now afternoon ?
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .
The Get out of here !
What kind of man are you ?
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .
I swear , you speak the truth .
For himself to ruin , " he says .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .
You speak well .
Is the worst well ?
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .
She will A pimp !
I've found it out .
What have you found out ?
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?
Let's go there .
I'll follow after you .
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .
That dirty rat !
I'm not one of his sluts .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .
That rotten scoundrel !
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?
You're not paying attention to me .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .
Wait good Nurse .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .
Goodbye .
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .
Goodbye .
Sing my praises to your mistress .
May God in heaven bless you .
Now please listen , sir .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?
Can your man keep a secret ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .
Give my compliments to your lady .
Yes , a thousand times .
Peter !
I'm ready .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .
Maybe she can't find him .
That can't be .
Oh , she's slow !
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?
Have you spoken to him ?
Send your man away .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .
I am tired .
Leave me alone for a minute .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
Can't you wait for a moment ?
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .
Is the news good or bad ?
Answer that question .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .
Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a foolish choice .
You don't know how to pick a man .
Romeo ?
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .
Well , do what you want .
Be good .
Have you had lunch yet ?
No , I haven't had lunch .
Everything you told me I already knew .
What does he say about our marriage ?
What about that ?
My head is pounding .
My back aches too ,
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?
Where is my mother ?
Why , she's inside .
Where else would she be ?
Your answer is so strange !
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?
Are you this impatient ?
Come on , you're being ridiculous !
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .
You're making such a fuss .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?
I do .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .
Go to the church .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .
Go .
I'll go to lunch .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .
I'm only trying to keep the peace .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .
What ?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .
Let's go at it , coward !
Use your clubs and spears !
Hit them !
Beat them down !
Down with the Capulets !
Down with the Montagues !
What's this noise ?
I want my sword .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .
Capulet , you villain !
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .
Wish me luck .
Thank you , dear Nurse .
Amen , amen .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .
Therefore , love each other in moderation .
That is the key to long-lasting love .
Too fast is as bad as too slow .
Here comes the lady .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .
Am I really like one of those guys ?
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .
And what about that ?
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .
Only you would look for a fight like that .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .
Your life insurance ?
That's foolish .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .
Well , well , I don't care .
Put it together with something else .
Make it a word and a blow .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .
We're talking here in a public place .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .
Out here everybody can see us .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .
I won't move to please anybody .
Well , may peace be with you .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .
He's not your man .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .
I am no villain .
So , goodbye .
I can tell that you don't know who I am .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .
So now turn and draw your sword .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .
What do you want from me ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .
I'll fight you .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .
Let's get away , Tybalt .
I've been hurt .
May a plague curse both your families .
I'm finished .
Did he get away clean ?
What , are you hurt ?
But it's enough .
Where is my page ?
Have courage , man .
The wound can't be that bad .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .
May a plague strike both your houses .
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !
Why the hell did you come in between us ?
He struck me from under your arm .
I thought it was the right thing to do .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .
May a plague strike both your families !
They've turned me into food for worms .
I'm done for .
Curse your families !
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .
This fight will decide who dies .
Romeo , get out of here .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .
Don't stand there shocked .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .
So get out of here !
Why are you waiting ?
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?
Tybalt is lying over there .
Speak , nephew .
Were you here when it started ?
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .
Tybalt was my nephew !
He was my brother's son !
Oh cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who started this fight ?
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .
He's not telling the truth .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Romeo must die .
Romeo killed Tybalt .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .
I'm involved in your rivalry .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .
Take away this body , and do what I say .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .
Come , night .
Come , Romeo .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .
Oh my , what's the news ?
Why do you look so upset ?
He's dead .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !
What an awful day !
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .
Has Romeo killed himself ?
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?
It did , it did .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .
Shame on Romeo !
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !
He was not born to be shameful .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
All this is comforting news .
Why , then , should I cry ?
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .
No words can express the pain .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .
Are you going to join them ?
I'll bring you there .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .
Pick up this rope ladder .
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !
Go to your bedroom .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .
I know where he is .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .
I'll go to him .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .
Romeo , come out .
Come out , you frightened man .
Father , what's the news ?
You know too much about suffering .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?
Ha , banishment ?
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .
Oh , deadly sin !
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !
It's torture , not mercy .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .
And yet you say that exile is not death ?
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .
They howl about banishment .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .
I drew my sword to part them .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .
Oh , where's Romeo ?
Have you seen him today ?
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .
Don't say anything else .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?
Let me talk to you about your situation .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .
Get up .
Somebody's knocking .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .
Why are you knocking so hard ?
Where do you come from ?
What do you want ?
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?
Where's Romeo ?
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .
Oh painful sympathy !
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
Stand up if you're really a man .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?
Nurse !
Ah sir , ah sir .
Well , death is the end for everybody .
Were you talking about Juliet ?
How is she ?
Where is she ?
How is she doing ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .
Are you a man ?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .
You have amazed me .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .
Have you killed Tybalt ?
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .
Get up , man !
Your Juliet is alive .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .
Be happy that you're alive .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .
Romeo is coming .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .
Educated men are so impressive !
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .
Hurry up , it's getting late .
This makes me feel so much better !
Now get out of here .
Good night .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .
Give me your hand .
It's late .
Farewell .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .
Well , we were all born to die .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .
Madam , good night .
Give my regards to your daughter .
I will .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?
Monday , my lord .
Monday !
Ha , ha !
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .
What do you think about Thursday ?
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .
Well go on home .
Thursday it is , then .
Are you going ?
It's still a long time until daybreak .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?
Night is over , and day is coming .
That light is not daylight , I know it .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .
So stay for a while .
You don't have to go yet .
Let me be captured .
Let me be put to death .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .
I want to stay more than I want to go .
Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .
It's not daylight .
It is , it is .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .
It's not true because she separates us .
More and more light .
More and more pain for us .
Madam .
Nurse ?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .
Day has broken .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .
Farewell , farewell !
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?
I don't know , and he won't tell me .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .
Farewell !
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .
Sadness takes away our color .
Goodbye , Goodbye !
Oh luck , luck .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .
Who's that calling ?
Is it my mother ?
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?
What's going on , Juliet ?
Madam , I am not well .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .
So stop crying .
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .
What villain , madam ?
That villain , Romeo .
That's because the murderer is alive .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !
Stop crying .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .
Please tell me .
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .
Now , I swear by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , he will not make me a joyful bride there .
How can I marry him , this husband , before he comes to court me ?
Please , tell my father , madam , I won't marry yet .
And , when I do marry , I swear , it will be Romeo , whom you know I hate , rather than Paris .
That's really news !
Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news .
What are you , girl ?
Some kind of fountain ?
Why are you still crying ?
Have you told her our decision ?
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !
How can this be ?
Isn't she proud of such a match ?
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?
But I am thankful that you have found it .
What is this ?
What is this fuzzy logic ?
What is this ?
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .
You disgust me , you little bug !
You worthless girl !
You pale face !
Shame on you !
What , are you crazy ?
Good father , I'm begging you on my knees , be patient and listen to me say just one thing .
Don't say anything .
Don't reply .
Don't talk back to me .
She disgusts me , the little hussy !
God in heaven bless her !
My lord , you're wrong to berate her like that .
And why , wise lady ?
Go blabber with your gossiping friends .
I've said nothing wrong .
Oh , for God's sake .
Can't I say something ?
Be quiet , you mumbling fool !
We don't need to hear it .
You're getting too angry .
Goddammit !
It makes me mad .
Day and night , hour after hour , all the time , at work , at play , alone , in company , my top priority has always been to find her a husband .
Thursday is coming .
Put your hand on your heart and listen to my advice .
If you act like my daughter , I'll marry you to my friend .
Think about it .
I won't break this promise .
Delay this marriage for a month , or a week .
Or , if you don't delay , make my wedding bed in the tomb where Tybalt lies .
Don't talk to me , because I won't say a word .
Do as you please , because I'm done worrying about you .
Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?
Give me comfort .
Don't you have one word of joy ?
Give me some comfort , Nurse .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman !
Romeo's a dishcloth compared to him .
Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .
Are you speaking from your heart ?
Amen !
What ?
Well , you have given me great comfort .
I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .
Alright , I will .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !
I'm going to the Friar to find out his solution .
If everything else fails , at least I have the power to take my own life .
On Thursday , sir ?
That's very soon .
You say you don't know what the girl thinks .
I don't like it .
Now you know the reason for the rush .
Look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell .
I'm happy to meet you , my lady and my wife .
That might be the case sir ,
Good morning , cousin .
Is it that early in the day ?
It's only just now nine o'clock .
Was that my father who left here in such a hurry ?
It was .
I don't have the thing that makes time fly .
You're in love ?
Out .
Out of love ?
So , where should we eat ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday .
What must be will be .
That is a certain truth .
Have you come to make confession to this father ?
If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .
Don't deny to him that you love me .
I'll confess to you that I love him .
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .
Your face is mine , and you have slandered it .
I have time for you now , my sad daughter .
God forbid that I should prevent sacred devotion !
Oh , Juliet , I already know about your sad situation .
I hear that you must marry this count on Thursday , and that nothing can delay it .
Don't tell me that you've heard about this marriage , Friar , unless you can tell me how to prevent it .
If you who are so wise can't help , please be kind enough to call my solution wise .
Hold on , then .
Tomorrow is Wednesday .
Tomorrow night make sure that you are alone .
Don't let the Nurse stay with you in your bedroom .
Give me the vial .
Give it to me !
Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .
Goodbye , dear Father .
You won't get any bad cooks from me .
How can you test them like that ?
So the cooks who can't lick their fingers aren't hired .
Go , get out of here .
We're unprepared for this wedding celebration .
Yes , that's true .
Look , she's come home from confession with a happy look on her face .
Holy Father Lawrence instructed me to fall on my knees and beg your forgiveness .
Send for the Count .
Go tell him about this .
I'll make this wedding happen tomorrow morning .
I met the young man at Lawrence's cell .
Well , I'm glad about this .
This is good .
Stand up .
Yes , alright , go , I say , and bring him here .
Now , before God , our whole city owes this friar a great debt .
Nurse , will you come with me to my closet and help me pick out the clothes and the jewelry I'll need to wear tomorrow ?
No , not until Thursday .
There's plenty of time .
We'll have the wedding at the church tomorrow .
It's already almost night .
And everything will be alright , I promise you , wife .
You should go to Juliet and dress her up .
I'm not going to bed tonight .
Leave me alone .
I'll pretend to be the housewife for once .
Yes , those are the best clothes .
What , are you busy ?
Do you need my help ?
I'm sure you have your hands full preparing for the sudden festivities .
Good night .
Only God knows when we'll meet again .
In my desperate situation , I have to act alone .
Alright , here's the vial .
What if this mixture doesn't work at all ?
Will I be married tomorrow morning ?
Lie down right there .
Oh , look !
I think I see my cousin Tybalt's ghost .
Wait , Tybalt , wait !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !
Here's a drink .
I drink to you .
No , cousin , I'm crying .
Good man , why are you crying ?
Yes , this is what love does .
What else is love ?
It's a sweet lozenge that you choke on .
Goodbye , cousin .
Wait .
I'll come with you .
If you leave me like this , you're doing me wrong .
I'm not myself .
I'm not here .
Tell me seriously , who is the one you love ?
You mean I should groan and tell you ?
Groan ?
No .
But tell me seriously who it is .
Take these keys and get more spices , Nurse .
They're calling for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen .
Come on , wake up , wake up , wake up !
The second cock crowed .
The curfew-bell rang .
Don't worry about the cost .
Go , you old housewife , go .
Go to bed , dear .
You'll be sick tomorrow because you've stayed up all night .
I've stayed up all night many times before for less important matters , and I've never gotten sick .
Yes , you've been a ladies ' man in your time .
A jealous woman , a jealous woman !
Now , fellow , what have you got there ?
Hurry up , hurry up .
I'm smart enough to find the logs myself without bothering Peter .
Right , and well said .
That guy's funny .
Goodness , it's daylight .
Wife !
What ?
Hey , Nurse !
Go wake Juliet .
Go and get her dressed .
I'll go and chat with Paris .
Hey , hurry up , hurry up !
The bridegroom is already here .
Hurry up , I say .
Mistress !
Hey , mistress !
I bet she's fast asleep .
Hey , lady !
Hey , love , I say !
Madam !
Sweetheart !
Hey , bride !
What , you don't say a word ?
You take your beauty sleep now .
How sound asleep she is !
Yes , let the count take you in your bed .
He'll wake you up , I bet .
Won't he ?
What's all the noise in here ?
Oh , sad day !
What is the matter ?
Look , look !
Oh , what a sad day !
Oh my , Oh my !
My child , my reason for living , wake up , look up , or I'll die with you !
For shame , bring Juliet out here .
Her bridegroom is here .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .
Curse the day !
Curse the day !
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
No !
Let me see her .
Oh no !
She's cold .
Her blood has stopped , and her joints are stiff .
She's been dead for some time .
She's dead , like a beautiful flower , killed by an unseasonable frost .
Oh , sad day !
Oh , this is a painful time !
Death , which has taken her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and won't let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?
She's ready to go , but she'll never return .
Death is my son-in-law .
Death is my heir .
My daughter married death .
I will die and leave Death everything .
Life , wealth , everything belongs to Death .
Have I waited so long to see this morning , only to see this ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !
This is the most miserable hour of all time !
I had only one child , one poor child , one poor and loving child , the one thing I had to rejoice and comfort myself , and cruel Death has stolen it from me !
Oh pain !
Oh painful , painful , painful day !
There has never been so black a day as today .
Oh painful day , Oh painful day !
She was tricked , divorced , wronged , spited , killed !
Cruel , cruel Death killed her .
Oh love !
Oh life !
There is no life , but my love is dead !
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !
Why did this have to happen now ?
My soul and not my child !
You are dead !
Be quiet , for shame !
The cure for confusion is not yelling and screaming .
You had this child with the help of heaven .
Now heaven has her .
She is in a better place .
You could not prevent her from dying someday , but heaven will give her eternal life .
The most you hope for was for her to marry wealthy and rise up the social ladder , that was your idea of heaven .
And now you cry , even though she has risen up above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so badly , that you go mad , even though she is in heaven .
It is best to marry well and die young , better than to be married for a long time .
Our wedding banquet will become a sad burial feast .
Our celebratory hymns will change to sad funeral marches .
Everyone prepare to take this beautiful corpse to her grave .
Don't disturb the heavens any more by trying to go against heaven's will .
Well , we can put away our pipes and go home .
Yes , well , things could get better .
No , not a sad song .
It's not the right time to play .
You won't , then ?
No .
Then I'll really give it to you .
What will you give us ?
No money , I swear .
I'll call you a minstrel .
Then I'll call you a serving-creature .
Then I'll smack you on the head with the serving-creature's knife .
I'll make you sing .
Do you hear me ?
Answer me like men .
Well , sir , because silver has a sweet sound .
Another studpid answer !
What do you say , James Well , I don't know what to say .
I'll answer for you .
It is "music with her silver sound , " because musicians have no gold to use to make sounds .
What an annoying man , this guy is !
Forget about him , Jack !
If I can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming soon .
Oh my !
How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?
How is my wife ?
Is my father well ?
How is my Juliet ?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .
Oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my job , sir .
You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .
Then you were right on target .
The woman I love is beautiful .
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .
Well , you're not on target there .
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .
Take my advice .
Don't think about her .
Teach me to forget to think !
Is it really true ?
Then I rebel against you , stars !
You know where I live .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .
I will leave here for Verona tonight .
Please , sir , have patience .
You look pale and wild as if you're going to hurt yourself .
Tsk , you're wrong .
Leave me and do what I told you to do .
Don't you have a letter for me from the friar ?
No , my good lord .
No matter .
Get on your way and hire those horses .
I'll be with you right away .
Well , Juliet , I'll lie with you tonight .
Let's see how .
Destructive thoughts come quickly to the minds of desperate men !
As I remember , this should be the house .
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .
Hey !
Pharmacist !
Who's that calling so loud ?
Come here , man .
I see that you are poor .
Here are forty ducats .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .
Holy Franciscan Friar !
Brother , hey !
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .
Welcome back from Mantua .
What does Romeo say ?
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?
Unhappy fortune !
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Now I must go to the tomb alone .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .
She's shut inside a dead man's tomb !
Give me your torch , boy .
Go away and stay apart from me .
Put the torch out , so I can't be seen .
Give me those flowers .
Do as I tell you .
Go .
The boy is warning me that someone approaches .
Who's ruining my rituals of true love ?
It's someone with a torch !
I must hide in the darkness for awhile .
Give me that pickax and the crowbar .
I'll go , sir , and I won't bother you .
That's the way to show me friendship .
Take this .
Good and noble young man , don't mess with someone who's desperate .
Get away from here and leave me .
Think about the ones who have died .
Let them put fear in your heart .
Please , young man , don't make me angry .
Oh , go away !
Don't stay here , go away .
Live , and from now on , say a madman mercifully told you to run away .
I'm arresting you as a criminal .
Are you going to provoke me ?
Alright , let's fight , boy !
Oh Lord , they're fighting !
I'll go call the watch .
Alright , I will .
It's Mercutio's relative , noble Count Paris !
What did my man say ?
I think he told me Paris was about to marry Juliet .
Isn't that what he said ?
Or was I dreaming ?
I'll bury you in a magnificent grave .
A grave ?
Oh no !
Juliet lies here , and her beauty fills this tomb with light .
Death has sucked the honey from your breath , but it has not yet ruined your beauty .
You haven't been conquered .
Oh , what better favor can I do for you than to kill the man who killed you with the same hand that made you die young .
Should I believe that death is in love with you , and that the awful monster keeps you here to be his mistress ?
Here , here I'll remain with worms that are your chamber-maids .
Oh , I'll rest here forever .
Eyes , look out for the last time !
Arms , make your last embrace !
His drugs work quickly .
So I die with a kiss .
Look at other beautiful girls .
Saint Francis , help me !
How often tonight have my old feet stumbled on gravestones !
I'm a friend , a friend who knows you well .
God bless you !
Tell me , my good friend , what is that light over there ?
It looks to me like it's burning in the Capulet tomb .
Who is it ?
Romeo .
How long has he been there ?
For a full half hour .
Go with me to the tomb .
I don't dare , sir .
Stay , then .
I'll go alone .
I'm suddenly afraid .
Oh , I'm very scared something awful has happened .
As I slept under this yew-tree here , I had a dream that my master and someone else were fighting and that my master killed him .
What is this blood that stains the stony entrance of this tomb ?
Oh friendly friar !
Where is my husband ?
I remember very well where I should be , and here I am .
Where is my Romeo ?
I hear some noise .
Lady , come out of the tomb .
A greater power than we can fight has ruined our plan .
Come , come away .
Your husband lies dead there , and Paris too .
Come , I'll place you among the sisterhood of holy nuns .
It's a cup , closed in my true love's hand ?
Poison , I see , has been the cause of his death .
I will kiss your lips .
Perhaps there's still some poison on them , to make me die with a medicinal kiss .
Oh , noise ?
Then I'll be quick .
Oh , good , a knife !
Rust inside my body and let me die .
This is the place .
There , where the torch is burning .
The ground is bloody .
This is a pitiful sight !
Go , tell the Prince .
Run to the Capulets .
Wake up the Montagues .
Have some others search .
Here's Romeo's man .
We found him in the churchyard .
Hold him in custody until the Prince gets here .
Here is a friar who's trembling , sighing and weeping .
We took this pickax and this shovel from him , as he was walking from this side of the graveyard .
Very suspicious .
Hold the friar too .
What crimes happen so early in the morning that I have to wake up before the usual time ?
What's the problem , that they cry out so loud ?
Some people in the street are crying "Romeo." Some are crying "Juliet , " and some are crying "Paris." They're all running in an open riot toward our tomb .
Investigate how this foul murder came about .
Oh heavens !
Oh wife , look at how our daughter bleeds !
That knife should be in its sheath on that Montague's back , but instead it's mis-sheathed in my daughter's breast .
Oh my !
This sight of death is like a bell that warns me I'm old and I'll die soon .
Oh , my liege , my wife died tonight .
Sadness over my son's exile stopped her breath .
What further pain must I endure in my old age ?
Look , and you'll see .
And then I'll be the leader of pain , and maybe I'll lead you as far as death .
In the meantime , hold on , and be patient .
I am the greatest , but I was able to do the least .
I have already condemned and excused myself .
Tell us what you know about this affair .
I will be brief because I'm not going to live long enough to tell a boring story .
In the meantime I wrote to Romeo and told him to come here on this awful night to help remove her from her temporary grave when the sleeping potion wore off .
I know all of this .
I brought my master news of Juliet's death .
Give me the letter .
Oh , brother Montague , give me your hand .
But what do you say to my request ?
I can only repeat what I've said before .
My daughter is still very young .
She's not even fourteen years old .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .
Tonight I'm having a feast that we've celebrated for many years .
At my humble house tonight , you can expect to see dazzling stars that walk on the ground and light the sky from below .
In the beautiful city of Verona , where our story takes place , a long-standing hatred between two families erupts into new violence , and citizens stain their hands with the blood of their fellow citizens .
Two unlucky children of these enemy families become lovers and commit suicide .
Their unfortunate deaths put an end to their parents ' feud .
Come along with me .
Find the people whose names are on this list ?
It is written that shoemakers and tailors should play with each others ' tools , that fisherman should play with paints , and painters should play with with fishing nets .
But I've been sent to find the people whose names are written on this list , and I can't read !
But here come some people , right in the nick of time .
For when you cut your shin .
What ?
Romeo , are you crazy ?
I'm locked up in a prison and deprived of food .
I'm whipped and tortured , May God give you a good evening .
Excuse me , sir , do you know how to read ?
I can read my own fortune in my misery .
Perhaps you've learned from life and not from books .
But please tell me , can you read anything you see ?
Yes , if I know the language and the letters .
I see .
Well , that's an Stay , fellow .
I can read .
Signor Martino and his wife and daughters , Count Anselme and his beautiful sisters , Vitruvio's widow , Signor Placentio and his lovely nieces , Mercutio and his brother Valentine , My uncle Capulet and his wife and daughters , My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ,
Signor Valentio and his cousin Tybalt , Lucio and the lively Helena." That's a nice group of people .
Where are they supposed to come ?
Up .
Where ?
To supper ?
To our house .
Whose house ?
My master's house .
Indeed , I should have asked you before who he was .
Now I'll tell you so you don't have to ask .
My master is the great and rich Capulet , and if you don't belong to the house of Montague , please come and drink a cup of wine .
Have a nice day !
The beautiful Rosaline whom you love so much will be at Capulet's traditional feast , along with every beautiful woman in Verona .
Go there and compare her objectively to some other girls I'll show you .
A woman more beautiful than the one I love ?
The sun itself has never seen anyone as beautiful since the world began .
I'll go with you .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?
Tell her to come to me .
I swear to you by my virginity at age twelve , I already told her to come .
Come on !
Who's calling me ?
Your mother .
Madam , I'm here .
What do you want ?
You know how young my daughter is .
Yes , I know her age down to the hour .
She's not even fourteen .
I'd bet fourteen of my own teeth , but , I'm sorry to say , I only have four teeth , she's not fourteen .
Whether it's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of Lammas Eve , she'll be fourteen .
She and Susan , God rest her and all Christian souls , were born on the same day .
Well , Susan died and is with God .
She was too good for me .
But like I said , on the night of Lammas Eve , she will be fourteen .
Yes , she will .
Indeed , I remember it well .
It's been eleven years since the earthquake .
I had put bitter wormwood on my breast as I was sitting in the sun , under the wall of the dovehouse .
But like I said , when she tasted the bitter wormwood on my nipple , the pretty little babe got irritated and started to quarrel with my breast .
Then the dovehouse shook with the earthquake .
There was no need to tell me to get out of there .
Oh , " he said , "Did you fall on your face ?
You'll Enough of this .
Please be quiet .
Yes , madam .
But I can't help laughing to think that the baby stopped crying and said , "Yes." I swear , she had a bump on her forehead as big as a rooster's testicle .
It was a painful bruise , and she was crying bitterly .
Yes , " said my husband , "Did you fall on your face ?
You'll fall backward when you grow up , won't you , Jule ? " And she stopped crying and said , "Yes." Now you stop too , Nurse , please .
May God choose you to receive his grace .
You were the prettiest baby I ever nursed .
If I live to see you get married someday , all my wishes will come true .
Tell me , my daughter Juliet , what is your attitude about getting married ?
It is an honor that I do not dream of .
Well , start thinking about marriage now .
Here in Verona there are girls younger than you , girls from noble families , who have already become mothers .
By my count , I was already your mother at just about your age , while you remain a virgin .
Well then , I'll say this quickly : the valiant Paris wants you as his bride .
What a man , young lady .
Summertime in Verona has no flower as fine as him .
Lose nothing ?
I'll look at him and try to like him , at least if what I see is likable .
But I won't let myself fall for him any more than your permission allows .
Everything's out of control .
Please , follow straight after me .
We'll follow you .
Go , girl , look for a man who'll give you happy nights at the end of happy days .
What will we say is our excuse for being here ?
Or should we enter without apologizing ?
It's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations like that .
Let them judge us however they please .
Give me a torch .
I don't want to dance .
No , noble Romeo , you've got to dance .
Not me , believe me .
You're wearing dancing shoes with nimble soles .
My soul is made out of lead , and it's so heavy it keeps me stuck on the ground so I can't move .
You're a lover .
Take Cupid's wings and fly higher than the average man .
His arrow has pierced me too deeply , so I can't fly high with his cheerful feathers .
I sink under the heavy weight of love .
We won't take their garbage .
I hit hard when I'm angry .
Angry enough to run away .
You won't stand and fight .
A dog from that house will make me angry enough to take a stand .
If you sink , you're dragging love down .
Is love really tender ?
I think it's too rough , too rude , too rowdy , and it pricks like a thorn .
If love plays rough with you , play rough with Come on , let's knock and go in .
Let playful people with light hearts dance .
Come on , we're wasting precious daylight .
Let's go !
No we're not , it's night .
We mean well by going to this masquerade ball , but it's not smart of us to go .
Why , may I ask ?
I had a dream last night .
So did I .
Well , what was your dream ?
My dream told me that dreamers often lie .
They lie in bed while they dream about the truth .
Oh , then I see you've been with Who's Queen Mab ?
Sometimes she rides over a courtier's lips , and he dreams of making money off of someone .
Sometimes she tickles a priest's nose with a Enough , enough !
Mercutio , be quiet .
The wind you're talking about is blowing us off our course .
Dinner is over , and we're going to get there too late .
Onward , lover boys !
Beat the drum .
Where's Potpan ?
When only one or two men have all the good manners , and even they are dirty , things are bad .
Take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates .
You , good friend , save me a piece of marzipan , and if you love me , have the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell .
Yes , boy , I'm ready .
They're looking for you in the great chamber .
We can't be in two places at once , both here and there !
Cheers , boys .
Be quick for a while and let the one who lives the longest take everything .
Welcome , gentlemen .
Whichever of you acts shy , I'll swear she has corns .
Welcome , gentlemen .
I swear , it must be thirty years .
It's been longer , it's been longer .
Lucentio's son is older than that , sir .
He's thirty years old .
Are you really going to tell me that ?
His son was a minor only two years ago .
I don't know , sir .
Oh , she shows the torches how to burn bright !
My eyes were liars , then , because I never saw true beauty before tonight .
I can tell by his voice that this man is a Montague .
Why are you acting so angry ?
Uncle , this man is a Montague , our enemy .
Is it young Romeo ?
That's him , that villain Romeo .
Calm down , gentle cousin .
Leave him alone .
He carries himself like a dignified gentleman , and , to tell you the truth , he has a reputation throughout Verona as a virtuous and well-behaved young man .
I wouldn't insult him in my own house for all the wealth in this town .
So calm down .
Just ignore him .
I won't tolerate him .
You But , uncle , we're being disrespected .
Go on , go on .
You're an insolent little boy .
Is that how it is , really ?
I know what I'll do .
You have to contradict me , do you ?
I'll teach you a lesson .
Don't saints and pilgrims have lips too ?
Yes , pilgrim , they have lips that they're supposed to pray with .
Well then , saint , let lips do what hands do .
Please grant my prayer so my faith doesn't turn to despair .
Saints don't move , even when they grant prayers .
Then don't move while I act out my prayer .
Now my sin has been taken from my lips by yours .
Then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ?
Sin from my lips ?
Give me my sin back .
You kiss like you've studied how .
Madam , your mother wants to talk to you .
Who is her mother ?
I nursed her daughter , whom you were just talking to .
Let me tell you , the man who marries her will become very wealthy .
No gentlemen , don't get ready to go now .
We have a little dessert coming up .
You're right .
The fight is between our masters , and we men who work for them .
It's all the same .
I'll be a harsh master to them .
Cut off their heads ?
You mean their Cut off their heads , take their maidenheads , whatever .
Take my remark in whichever sense you like .
The women you rape are the ones who'll have to "sense" it .
Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .
You're Pull out your tool now .
I have my naked sword out .
Come over here , nurse .
Who is that gentleman ?
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .
I don't know his name .
Go ask .
What's this ?
What's this ?
The strangers are all gone .
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .
Call to him , Mercutio .
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .
Romeo !
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .
What I'm saying can't anger him .
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .
Virginity makes her look sick and green .
Let it go .
Oh , there's my lady !
Oh , it is my love .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .
So what ?
Her eyes are saying something .
She's not talking to me .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .
Oh , my !
Who are you ?
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .
Aren't you Romeo ?
And aren't you a Montague ?
Tell me , how did you get in here ?
And why did you come ?
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .
If they see you , they'll murder you .
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .
Do you love me ?
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .
What should I swear by ?
Don't swear at all .
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .
You would take it back ?
Why would you do that , my love ?
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .
But I'm wishing for something I already have .
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .
I hear a noise inside .
Sweet Montague , be true .
Stay here for a moment .
I'll come back .
Oh , blessed , blessed night !
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .
Don't worry about me .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .
Let them start something .
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .
You mean however they dare .
I'll bite my thumb at them .
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?
I'm biting my thumb .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?
Are you trying to start a fight ?
Start a fight ?
No , sir .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .
Romeo !
My baby hawk ?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
By nine o'clock .
I won't fail .
From now until then seems like twenty years .
I have forgotten why I called you back .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .
It's almost morning .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .
I wish I was your bird .
My sweet , so do I .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .
Good night , good night .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .
I hope you sleep peacefully .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .
Good morning , father .
God bless you .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .
Your last guess is right .
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .
With Rosaline , father ?
That's good , my boy .
But where have you been ?
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .
